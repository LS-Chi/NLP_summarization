0,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway continues his march through the political events of the 1930s. He discusses the federal governmentâs role in African American communities, the development of black-run organizations dedicated to saving America from poverty, and the elimination of the all-white primary voting class. The New Negro Alliance was formed in 1932 by a local group of teenagers who were frustrated with the new tactical change in the U.S. government. It became the catalyst for a discussion of southern racism in the early 1920s, and it became clear that people were prepared to enlarge the gap between whites and African Americans. Yet as the Cold War marched on, deeper problems revolved around racial insubordination","summarize: The 1930s was a decade filled with economic, legal, political, and social controversy. In this lecture, Professor Holloway looks at the Great Depression and the federal governmentâs responses to it, including the New Dealâs impact on African Americans, both materially and symbolically. As the federal government openly courted their favor, African Americans organized various political groups to monitor federal activities. In the second portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway examines the achievements of the Black Cabinet, the injustices of the Scottsboro Boysâ case, and the efficacy of the âDonât Buy Where You Canâ",0.46082949308755755,0.14883720930232558,0.04694835680751173,0.2580645161290323,0.2580645161290323
1,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on the momentous events that led to the Montgomery bus boycott and the NAACPâs Silent Protest Parade from July 1968 to March 1972. The movement began seriously in 1969 when black radicals who were frustrated with the way the Black leader was treated. It became clear that black leaders were prepared to face charges of immorality on a daily basis, and if they could suppress these charges, the rest of the class would submit to their governance again. Yet as momentum for the movement marched away, charges of white supremacist violence would decimate the black vote in the second half of the 1930s, including the flight of one black woman to Montgomery, and the racial backlash against","summarize: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement have become embodied in each other. But in this lecture, Professor Holloway asks: what of the other activists in the struggle? What of the other organizations involved in the struggle? And what of the history of the struggle before King reluctantly emerged on the scene? By uncovering the histories of the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, the death of Emmett Till, the Greensboro student sit-ins, and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one finds differing responses to violence and multiple approaches to attacking racial bias and discrimination. Professor Holloway also draws attention to the gender dynamics",0.33198380566801616,0.11428571428571428,0.0411522633744856,0.23481781376518218,0.23481781376518218
2,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the cultural politics of the early 1970s. He discusses Jacksonâs ability to connect with the African American community through a variety of forms of political organization, including the Black Political Convention, the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, and the 1972 Chicago race riots. The militancy seen in these campaigns is linked to a larger cultural trend of black radicalism and the development of black-run organizations dedicated to saving America. Yet for all of the coalition building taking place, deeper problems revolved around Jacksonâ½a-century old ideas of accountability and responsibility for those ideas. These issues remain unresolved today, and will likely continue to be addressed in the future.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a political biography of Jesse Jackson as a way to help understand the shifting cultural politics of the 1960s, the rise of a different array of politics in the 1970s, and the high politics of the 1980s. Professor Holloway traces Jacksonâs ascension into Martin Luther Kingâs inner-circle, his work in Chicago with Operation Breadbasket and then later with Operation PUSH, his reaction to Kingâs assassination, his national economic boycotts, and his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns.

3,"summarize: Professor Holloway focuses on the cultural politics of the late 1970s. He examines the issues of race in America, including the passage of the Dred Scott decision, the birth of the Republican party, and the elimination of the all-white primary. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Hollowey shows how cultural politics shaped the early 1970s, as well as the mid-twentieth century African American vote. During this time, black Communists and Socialists held constitutional conventions throughout the country to control the movementâs trajectory. The event also appears to have helped shape the tone and tactics of the popular imagination of the nation. At the same time, this hyper-racial rhetoric targeting black radicals","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the connections between media and high politics during the late 1980s and 1990s and reveals the ways that race was replaced by a series of keywordsâsuch as crime, drugs, and welfareâthat acted as racial signifiers in our national discourse. An examination of the political rhetoric from the George H.W.

4,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway expands our understanding of black America by looking back at the African American experience in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. He documents the development of black consciousness, the power of whites to change the color of the nation, and theorizes that this process took place rather smoothly due to the good relations between African Americans and whites. The second half of the lecture introduces students to two prominent black intellectuals in the early twentieth century. W.H.Du Bois, a former student in ECON 252 from Alabama, was one of the first African American intellectuals to work on raceâs ability to bring about social change in society, and the NAACPâ�","summarize: In the closing decades of the 1800s, African Americans witnessed the end of Reconstruction, the Redemption of the white South, and increased threats to their political, economic, physical, and psychological well-being. Historians often refer to this era as the ânadir,â the lowest point, in the post-Emancipation black experience. But, as Professor Holloway explains in this lecture, the oppressive realities of black life did not silence the most dedicated black activists. During this time, a new generation of black political and intellectual leaders, including Alexander Crummell, Anna Julia Cooper, and W. E. B. Du Bois, dedicated themselves to",0.39631336405529954,0.11162790697674418,0.009389671361502346,0.22119815668202764,0.22119815668202764
5,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway documents the historical struggle for uplift and Redemption in the African American community. He focuses on the individualâs connection with a divine power, the powerful promise of justice, and the racial backlash that was often conspicuously elitist. Professor Hollowight also touches on the role of white-run organizations such as the Congressional Black Caucus, the Emancipation Proclamation, and NAACP. He also provides an overview of the civil rights movement and its trajectory, closing with an analysis of the riots that summer in Watts, a poor neighborhood in Los Angeles, and black Communists who were working to bring about change in the country. An example of this type of activism is","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway explains the two major schools of thought that emerged at the end of the century to solve the problems of black social and economic distress. The accommodationists, like Booker T. Washington, believed that the quickest way to improve the quality of black life was to forge a social peace with powerful whites, temporarily accepting the continued separation of the races and advocating vocational education as a pragmatic way for blacks to improve their lives. Opposed to Washington were people like Anna Julia Cooper and W.E.B. Du Bois who embraced assimilation and saw higher education as the cure-all to racialized problems.

6,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by reading Fitzgeraldâs relation to sociology. She shows how his theories of social types, including the notion of a social type, are applied to the depiction of the individual in the novel. Professor Dimock then connects Fitzgerald with other modernists such as Bernard Crick, E. W. Burgess, and Robert E. Park. In their final lecture, Dimock discusses the emergence of Saul Sontag in the American West, where he starts to classify individuals by looking them through the lens of John Stuart Mill. Fears of poverty and socially undesirable conditions that make these cases unique, even if they are only partially understood.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock demonstrates how four of Fitzgeraldâs most famous short storiesââThe Rich Boy,â âBabylon Revisited,â âThe Diamond as Big as the Ritz,â and âBernice Bobs Her Hairâârepresent âsocial types,â generic identities that Fitzgerald explores as forms of social reality.

7,"summarize: Professor Blight continues his discussion of the sevenfold permutations of the affirmative action policy in the past forty years, which has resulted in thousands of new cases of lynchings across the country. The most prominent one is John C. Calhoun, who was lynchified for the African American community in the 1970s. For all of his power to back up the threat of violence, the lecture has been devoted to the causes of black-run organizations such as the Congressional Black Political Party, the NAACP, and the Sontaggee group. The lynching itself is an instance of the social being held together by cultural ignorance and the need for a public understanding of black history.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of by analyzing the contrast Robert Jordan draws between âdistant homesâ and the on-site environment of the Spanish Civil War. She juxtaposes his invocations of Paris and Missouri to the rooted communities of the guerillas, and reads analogies of racial and ethnic conflictâspecifically, the references to the Moors in Spain and persecuted blacks in Americaâas a point of tension, an ironic commentary on the coexistence of the distant home and the on-site environment. She concludes with a reading of the American Civil War as a temporally distant home which Jordan tries to",0.34862385321100914,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.2385321100917431,0.2385321100917431
8,"summarize: Professor Mazzotta focuses on the events leading up to the end of theÂ. The fact that the women were so crucial to the Spanish Civil War was emphasized. The central figure in the case of Maria Guinard is examined, as are the ways in which we see the rape of women, as well as the method used to kill them. The nature of rape and the possibility of self-mutilation is also addressed. At the lectureâs conclusion, a video of Maria is shown showing how the rape victim is shown to have been taken by the deed, rather than the man. It is unclear how much of her mental instability and what will be done about it, and how much responsibility","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by reading the novel as a narrative of dispossession and repossession. She argues that the rape of Maria, which takes place in front of a barbershop mirror, enacts one type of disempowerment; the end of Robert Jordanâs life represents another, but with the potential for redemption. She shows how Jordan vacillates between a âhaveâ and a âhave not,â depending on how ironically one understands Mariaâs question âWhat hast thou?â",0.3152709359605912,0.07960199004975124,0.020100502512562814,0.187192118226601,0.187192118226601
9,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of Hemingwayâs career as a leading American screenwriter by comparing the ways historians read and understanding the world war. She points out how Hemingawayâwayâ½aâcan sometimes seems to have been a man preaching a message to the Greeks. However, he also writes a few words on the one hand to remind the Greeks of the human cost of World War I, and to remind them of the real meaning of it, and its overwhelming power in the Greek world. In his final letter to the students, Professor Dimock argues that Hemingingway should be remembered for some of his other works, including,","summarize: Professor Dimock introduces the class to the works of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner, the premiere writers of American modernism. She orients their novels along three âscalesâ of interpretation: global geopolitics, experimental narration, and sensory detail. Invoking the writings of critic Paul Fussell, she argues that all three writers are united by a preoccupation with World War I and the implications that the Great War has for irony in narrative representation.",0.34224598930481287,0.07567567567567568,0.02185792349726776,0.19251336898395727,0.19251336898395727
10,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by observing Joe Brownâs relationship with family and social groups. She points out how Joe Brown uses the word â½-homicide to denote both malice and malice, and also shows how his decision to self-blacken expresses his view of the world in the second part of the episode. Joe Brown makes a confession to Joanna Brown about his status as a dietitian, and distributes stickers to help students who have made the pledge stick to their resolve. Professor Dimock also highlights Joe Brownerâs admission to guilt for his adulterous wife Joanna, and his diffuse anger against her sexuality.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses on the unresolved problem of race in, focusing her discussion on the variety of reflexive and calculated uses of the word âniggerâ as a charged term toward Joe Christmas. She shows how the semantic burden of the word varies â used under duress by Joe Brown and the dietician, deliberately made light of by Hightower and Bobbie, fused with the contrary meanings of Calvinist theology by Joanna Burden, and finally ironized by Joe Christmas himself.

11,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses her introductory lecture on the evolution of race relations in the novel. She shows how Faulkner draws connections between himself and his African American protegÃ©, Caddy Compson, and Quentin Guillory, and reveals how his focus is on race relations among the black community. Professor Dimock concludes by observing the mental capacity of Benjy Compson to understand the world through his study of him.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of by juxtaposing Quentinâs stream-of-consciousness to his brother Benjyâs narrative subjectivity. Professor Dimock argues that Faulkner uses stylistic parallels between the two sections to communicate âkinshipâ and âvariationâ between the two narrators.

12,summarize: This second lecture on relativity theory begins with a introduction of students to the major topics in Special Relativity. The concepts of mass and velocity are introduced and explained. A number of problems are worked out to familiarize students with mathematics related to Einsteinâs position at the turn of the 19th century.,"summarize: One last key concept in Special Relativity is introduced before discussion turns again to black celestial bodies (black holes in particular) that manifest the relativistic effects students have learned about in the previous lectures. The new concept deals with describing events in a coordinate system of space and time. A mathematical explanation is given for how space and time reverse inside the Schwarzschild radius through sign changes in the metric. Evidence for General Relativity is offered from astronomical objects. The predicted presence and subsequent discovery of Neptune as proof of General Relativity are discussed, and stellar mass black holes are introduced.Step by Step into a Black HoleCourtesy of Ute Kraus, Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Gravitations",0.3255813953488372,0.03529411764705882,0.011904761904761906,0.1744186046511628,0.1744186046511628
13,"summarize: The lecture begins with a question-and-answer session about the Big Bang. Topics include the role of science in the expansion of the universe, the possibility of a multiverse, and how we might predict it. The actual event occurred billions of years ago at a rate comparable to the speed of light or dark matter. This question is followed by a series of scientific arguments explaining how science can predict the future events from the perspective of a number of different perspectives.","summarize: Professor Bailyn returns to the subject of the expansion of the universe to offer explanations that do not require belief in the Big Bang theory. One alternative is a theory that, in the past, the entire universe was reduced to an âinitial singularity,â in which everything was much closer, and therefore denser and hotter. Since the universe is in constant flux, however, it follows that in the future things will drift apart. The Steady State explanation for the expansion of the universe is then explained. Coined as a derogatory term meant to ridicule supporters of the Big Bang theory, Steady State purports that new energy and matter are constantly created as the universe expands",0.31155778894472363,0.09137055837563451,0.041025641025641026,0.21105527638190955,0.21105527638190955
14,"summarize: The fact that black holes exist in the center of the universe is discussed. A number of problems are worked out to familiarize students with mathematics related to black hole physics, such as dark energy and dark matter. In a longer question and answer session, Professor Bailyn discusses how the existence of black holes coincides with the Big Bang cosmology of which Einstein developed a model. The results of these investigations are currently ambiguous and controversial.","summarize: Class begins with a review of the mysterious nature of dark matter, which accounts for three quarters of the universe. Different models of the universe are graphed. The nature, frequency, and duration of supernovae are then addressed. Professor Bailyn presents data from the Supernova Cosmology Project and pictures of supernovae taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery of dark energy is revisited and the density of dark energy is calculated. The Big Rip is presented as an alternative hypothesis for the fate of the universe.",0.3902439024390244,0.07407407407407408,0.012499999999999999,0.2073170731707317,0.2073170731707317
15,"summarize: Class begins with a discussion of supernovae. The event occurs when the universe undergoes a series of events, sometimes described as the expansion of the universe. These events are caused by the balance between the rate of dark energy and dark matter in the Universe over time, and other effects of the Cosmic Microwave Background which is composed of tiny modulations of Cosmic Micahave Background that scientists have attempted to identify through gravitational lensing. Finally, Professor Bailyn offers a slideshow of lectures on cosmology.","summarize: Reasons for the expansion of the universe are addressed at the start of this lecture, focusing especially on the acceleration of dark energy. Supernovae were the first evidence for the existence of dark energy. Two other proofs are presented. The first is the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is perfectly smooth and equal in all directions. It firmly supports the Big Bang theory. Projects attempting to measure it, such as COBE and WMAP, are discussed. Secondly, Large-Scale Clustering is introduced: by measuring the degree of clustering, astronomers hope to advance their understanding of dark energy and dark matter. Computer simulations of the evolution of the universe are shown.",0.43781094527363185,0.17085427135678394,0.1116751269035533,0.24875621890547264,0.24875621890547264
16,"summarize: transits are events that help astronomers to observe the existence of planets, or explain why they exist. They are caused by the velocity of the planetâs elliptical orbit, which is measured using the radial velocity method. The event occurs when a celestial body moves across the face of the star it revolves around and blocks some of its light. By calculating the amount of light that is being obscured astronomers can obtain important information about both star and planet, such as size, density, radial velocity and more.","summarize: Class begins with a problem on transits and learning what information astronomers obtain through observing them. For example, radii of stars can be estimated. Furthermore, applying the Doppler shift method, one can find the mass of a star. Finally, a starâs density can be calculated. A second method for identifying planets around stars is introduced: the astrometry method. The method allows for an extremely accurate assessment of a starâs precise position in the sky. Special features of the astrometry method are discussed and a number of problems are solved. A short summary is given on the three methods astronomers use to identify exoplanets.

He introduces the function and anatomy of blood flow in the body, and explains how this flow pattern affects blood flow (i.e., oxygenation) and pressure drop (tissue metabolic rate), and the effect of four valves which help direct flow. Finally, modeling the body as a well-stirred vessel, he draws attention to the areas that may be affected by oxygenation/resonance effects of airway currents, such as lensing, dilution, and scar healing.","summarize: Professor Saltzman discusses the biophysics of the circulatory system. He begins by describing the anatomy of different types of blood vessels, and states the relationship between pressure difference (ÎP) as the driving force for fluid flow (Q) in a tube (i.e., blood vessel) with some resistance R (ÎP = RQ). R can be calculated using if dimensions of the tube () and fluid viscosity () are known:Â.

Finally, modeling a rubber band as a functional object, he considers the properties of different materials, such as hair, synthetic rubber, and plastics.","summarize: Professor Saltzman introduces the material properties of elasticity and viscosity. He describes two separate experimental setups to measure the elasticity and the viscosity of a material. Material elasticity can be defined in terms of stress-strain property, and defines the Youngâs modulus (E), which is the slope of the stress-strain curve. Fluid viscosity, on the other hand, is described by shear stress.

He also comments on whether or not quantum mechanics is realistic and argues that predicting the trajectory of a photonâs electron pair through a conjugation may be affected by electron repulsion. The experimental methods used to illustrate these are discussed in order to show how close two electrons in an electron pair can be, and how much time is spent examining the atomic orbit of CHÂ and NHÂ bonds. Quantum mechanics suggests that the electron difference density in the nucleus is due to electron-pair interaction between the electron and her orbital.Professor Shank","summarize: This lecture brings experiment to bear on the previous theoretical discussion of bonding by focusing on hybridization of the central atom in three XHÂ molecules. Because independent electron pairs must not overlap, hybridization can be related to molecular structure by a simple equation.

It is shown how to calculate the change in atomic weight through a number of experiments. Quantum mechanics also describes bonding between atoms, which requires solving a differential equation that depends on electron-pair repulsion. It also describes the behavior of electrons when they vibrate within a narrow space, as well as the relationship between electron difference density and electron spin.

The limited kinetic order in addition to free-radical kinetics suggests that âradical stabilizationâ½-electron strainââ= lÎ±, indicating that Î± is stable.

Fractional kinetic orders suggest dissociation of a dominant aggregate to give a smaller reactive species. An apparent negative kinetic order, due to competition with a second-order process, leads to spontaneous deracemization of chiral crystals. Changes in bond dissociation energies can be due to differences in bonds or in radicals. Although it is often said that the order of alkyl radical stability is tertiary > secondary > primary, careful analysis suggests that the order of bond dissociation energies may be due to differences in the alkanes rather than in the radicals.

Many steps are envisioned (two-step involving either pentavalent or trivalent carbon intermediates, one-step). These steps involve considering whether or not alcohols were oxidizing, and whether it is appropriate to oxidize such a chemical shift. The Baeyer-Crafts acidition mechanism is described using the parallel bond, which can be used to demonstrate the nature of an acid- and base-catalyzed polymer. It can be demonstrated via analogous techniques.

He argues that the Greeks are worthy of our study not only because of their vast achievements and contributions to Western civilization (such as in the fields of science, law, and politics) but also because they offer a unique perspective on humanity. To the Greeks, man was both simultaneously capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes; he was both great and important, but also mortal and fallible.

46,"summarize: There are several factors that impact the climate on Earth. Different areas have different climates depending on factors such as their latitude and surrounding terrain. The overall climate of Earth is characterized by high concentrations of latent heat, cold salty water, and winds of about -2Â°C. Heat can increase with altitude in the atmosphere, and precipitation and evaporation change the temperature of the Earth system. Changes in the depth of the thermohaline layer also affect coastal ecosystems. Seasonality is a frequency effect of high pressure, high-energy ocean currents, and changes in land mass. Mountain glaciers form at the boundaries of three primary groups which affect coastal upwelling offshore of South America. Mountain ridges form from mountains to rivers","summarize: This lecture provides an overview of the physical aspects of earthâs biomes. Temperature, water, latitude, and altitude all come into play. Regions with similar levels of these climatic features tend to have similar life-forms living there.

Evolution guides how behavior of these organisms will vary across species, and how strategies will change over time.","summarize: Adaptive Evolution is driven by natural selection. Natural selection is not âsurvival of the fittest,â but rather âreproduction of the fittest.â Evolution can occur at many different speeds based on the strength of the selection driving it.

Then we discuss how we might build a model of financial equilibrium between individuals and communities by borrowing long and lending short, and showing how our model lets us calculate equilibrium prices and allocations in a simple economy. A critique of the solution to the problem is offered, but it is unclear how we could solve it. We suggest some examples of other real-world problems, such as bank runs and exploding populations. But we think about these first-order problems first using the notion of risk management, and then using it to construct a model for future problems. There are several ways in which we might solve these problems, including personal wealth management","summarize: We consider games in which players move sequentially rather than simultaneously, starting with a game involving a borrower and a lender. We analyze the game using âbackward induction.â The game features moral hazard: the borrower will not repay a large loan. We discuss possible remedies for this kind of problem. One remedy involves incentive design: writing contracts that give the borrower an incentive to repay. Another involves commitment strategies; in this case providing collateral. We consider other commitment strategies such as burning boats.

Then he turns his attention to the Big Bang theory of value-to-maturity. In answering these questions, Professor Rae shows how certain mathematical concepts are allowed to be used to explain some of the fundamental economic decisions that are made in business situations. For example, it may be shown that if a firm chooses a smaller, older model, then it can be rational to continue with a lower stock price. However, this result depends on its ability to calculate the value of bonds and other financial assets. The lecture ends with a question-and-answer period on a variety of topics","summarize: We first apply our big ideaâbackward inductionâto analyze quantity competition between firms when play is sequential, the Stackelberg model. We do this twice: first using intuition and then using calculus. We learn that this game has a first-mover advantage, and that it comes commitment and from information in the game rather than the timing per se. We notice that in some games having more information can hurt you if other players know you will have that information and hence alter their behavior.

First we define the mathematical basis for the game, pointing out that there are two players in the game and that each should make decisions based on those assumptions. We then extend this definition to a game in which each player is allowed to make decisions about continuing or ending goals. We discuss how such games can help us understand the long-term goal of happiness in general, and explain some of the other possible outcomes.","summarize: We first discuss Zermeloâs theorem: that games like tic-tac-toe or chess have a solution. That is, either there is a way for player 1 to force a win, or there is a way for player 1 to force a tie, or there is a way for player 2 to force a win. The proof is by induction. Then we formally define and informally discuss both perfect information and strategies in such games. This allows us to find Nash equilibria in sequential games.

This time, however, we do not allow these games because they are too simplified to apply directly to actual examples in the real world. We introduce this idea first to defending the Roman Empire against Hannibal; then to defending America against Hannibal. In the second part we play the game to see whether or not Ale can still be a good leader.

We discuss how to build the idea of reputation into game theory; in particular, in setting like this where a threat or promise would otherwise not be credible. The key idea is that players may not be completely certain about other playersâ payoffs or even their rationality. In the second half of the lecture, we stage a duel, a game of pre-emption. The key strategic question in such games is when; in this case, when to fire. We use two ideas from earlier lectures, dominance and backward induction, to analyze the game.

Professor Rae presents the example of a Connecticut newspaper from July 2008, and discusses why it is important to be suspicious of details of corporate secrecy. The difficulties in colluding with the government about information transmission, for example, leads to problems of government secrecy, which leads to consumers having limited means of protecting their information. Governmental secrecy also prevents us from becoming able to challenge or test the accuracy of documents.","summarize: We look at two settings with asymmetric information; one side of a game knows something that the other side does not. We should always interpret attempts to communicate or signal such information taking into account the incentives of the person doing the signaling. In the first setting, information is verifiable. Here, the failure explicitly to reveal information can be informative, and hence verifiable information tends to come out even when you donât want it to. We consider examples of such information unraveling. Then we move to unverifiable information. Here, it is hard to convey such information even if you want to.

As an example, we play and analyze a class investment game to illustrate that people care about what others think about buying a good, and that it is a waste of money. But we also learn that people have very different values compared to others. This lets us calculate the value of a dollar invested in the stock price of a goods, and it helps to understand how much of its value is being determined by those assumptions.

We first distinguish two extremes: common values and private values. We hold a common value auction in class and discover the winnerâs curse, the winner tends to overpay. We discuss why this occurs and how to avoid it: you should bid as if you knew that your bid would win; that is, as if you knew your initial estimate of the common value was the highest. This leads you to bid much below your initial estimate. Then we discuss four forms of auction: first-price sealed-bid, second-price sealed-bid, open ascending, and open descending auctions.

You are willing to bet on your prepayment forecasts, but not on which way interest rates will move. The fastest way to compute these is by using the method of replication. It is shown that banks know how much collateral it will take to prepay, and that it should be worth about 13-13% of your remaining balance. prepaying lets you calculate the borrowerâs remaining balance, and also lets you mitigate the extra risk.

The option to prepay, the refinancing option, makes the mortgage much more complicated than a coupon bond, and therefore something that a hedge fund could make money trading. In this lecture we discuss how to build and calibrate a model to forecast prepayments in order to value mortgages.

You are willing to bet on your prepayment forecasts, but not on which way interest rates will move. A perfect model shows that it is impossible to hedge yourself against so many contingencies. It is best when you are right about what you know, and it is difficult when you think about it. With these assumptions, it is possible to make a trade off between two. On the one hand, it may seem impossible to mitigate the extra risk, but it is important to hedge carefully.

The CAPM model accurately fits the characteristics of a firmâs stock price and financial system, which consequently renders beating the market impossible. In a perfect world without uncertainty, the stock price would follow a predictable trajectory, but not only would it hold steady, but also would collapse, if the underlying risks could be extrapolated to other asset classes. This would lead to a collapse of the U.S. housing market, which would bring about a short-lived financial crisis, rather than a strong financial market.","summarize: This lecture addresses some final points about the CAPM. How would one test the theory? Given the theory, whatâs the right way to think about evaluating fund managersâ performance?

He notes that in many instances, a partnership or investment firm should be a public institution, and that this form of financial financing structures important for all manner of activities. However, in other cases, partnerships and investment trusts (IPPOs) are a relatively recent invention. In one case, government support of these companies through partnerships and share repurchases (or real estate investment trusts), is often tied with economic concerns of small investors and other public causes. The government has used these issues to try to make sense of the collapse of the U.S. housing market and bail out failing financial institutions.","summarize: Real estate finance has been crucially important throughout its very long and complex history.

His preoccupation with his blindness and his blindness, and his unique contributions to the micro-genre, are discussed.","summarize: An introduction to John Milton: man, poet, and legend. Miltonâs place at the center of the English literary canon is asserted, articulated, and examined through a discussion of Miltonâs long, complicated association with literary power. The conception of Miltonic power and its calculated use in political literature is analyzed in the feminist writings of Lady Mary Chudleigh, Mary Astell, and Virginia Woolf. Later the god-like qualities often ascribed to Miltonic authority are considered alongside Satanâs excursus on the constructed nature of divine might in, and the notorious characterâs method of analysis is shown to be a useful",0.39999999999999997,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.22,0.22

In fact, many of Rothâ s questions about race are raised, as well as whether race is a factor in American life. One answer to this question is whether or not race is an epidemic, or whether it is appropriate and under what conditions.","summarize: In this lecture on, Professor Hungerford traces the ways that Rothâs novel conforms to and pushes beyond the genre she calls the Identity Plot. Exploring the various ways that race can be construed as category, mark, biology, or performance, the novel ultimately construes the defining characteristic of its protagonistâs race to be its very concealment.

The question of how to categorize a text is raised, as Professor Dimock demonstrates with particular attention to the letters of Edward Pynchon, the son of an illiterate mother whose family lived through World War I, and the correspondence of her proxy Alex. Drawing on the theoretical writings of critics Elaine Scarry and Susan Sontag, and John Guillory, Professor Amy Hungerford shows how the tensions between the American and British world have extended to the American heart.","summarize: In this first of two lectures on the studentsâ choice end-of-semester novel, Jonathan Safran Foerâs (2002), Professor Hungerford models several methods for approaching and evaluating a new work of fiction. She shows how Foer borrows and adapts themes and styles from other authors on the syllabus in service to his ambition as a writer to demonstrate the power of narrative fiction to address the great historical traumas of our time. In thus attempting to marry the nineteenth-century social novel with Postmodernist, or late Modernist, techniques, Foer participates in an emerging tradition that risks the confusion between resonant emotion and sentimental clichÃ©",0.3203883495145631,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.17475728155339804,0.17475728155339804
71,"summarize: In this second lecture on, Professor Amy Hungerford discusses the development of the New Critical framework of literary criticism, which can be divided into three main branches: theoretical, political, and philosophical. Having considered the ways in which people read literature, and considering the ways that words we are familiar with, Hungerford shows how this approach illuminates some of the important individual histories of twentieth-century literature. The novelâs first section is devoted to a young black male who, in the context of his older sister Lena, constructs a beautiful and poisonous vision of her identity through his interactions with his family and servants. The editor also provides him with several examples of how this image comes to be associated with other","summarize: Professor Amy Hungerford introduces the first of three lectures on NabokovâsÂ by surveying studentsâ reactions to the novel, highlighting the conflicting emotions readers feel, enjoying Nabokovâs virtuosic style, but being repelled by the violence of his subject matter. Nabokovâs childhood in tsarist Russia provides some foundation for his interest in memory, imagination, and language. Finally, Professor Hungerford shows how Nabokov, through the voice of his protagonist Humbert, in his own voice in the epilogue, and in the voice of âJohn Ray, Jr",0.35406698564593303,0.07729468599033816,0.01951219512195122,0.20095693779904306,0.20095693779904306

She points out how his style and his relation to other modernists have been characterized by a focus on the aesthetic, rather than only the question of aestheticism. Drawing on the theoretical writings of critics Elaine Scarry and Susan Sontag, and the artistic representations of Sergei Eisenstein, Professor Dimock shows how the novel takes on some of the questions raised by those questions, including whether or not the primary focus of the novel is on the characters themselves, or what constitutes them.","summarize: In this guest lecture, Teaching Fellow Andrew Goldstone provides us with some key concepts for understanding Modernism and Nabokovâs relation in particular to his literary forebears T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. Positing the âknightâs moveâ as a description of Nabokovâs characteristically indirect, evasive style, Goldstone argues that Nabokovâs parodies of Modernist form in fact reveal his deep commitment to some of the same aesthetic principles.

The archival evidence suggests that Freudâs theory of the unconscious mind is predestined to human knowledge, and that his conception of the text comes from his own experience as well as the subconscious of many other writers, such as Austen, Eliot, and Cubist painters. The emergence of theories of psychoanalysis in the nineteenth century is traced through the writings of Edvard Munch, William Wordsworth, and John Guillory. The authorâs contributions to these discussions are particularly important, and contribute to the style and themes of his work","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry turns his attention to the relationship between authorship and the psyche. Freudâs meditations on the fundamental drives governing human behavior are read through the lens of literary critic Peter Brooks. The origins of Freudâs work on the âpleasure principleâ and his subsequent revision of it are charted, and the immediate and constant influence of Freudian thought on literary production is asserted. Brooksâ contributions to literary theory are explored: particularly the coupling of multiple Freudian principles, including the pleasure principle and the death wish, and their application to narrative structures.

She begins with an overview of the historical conditions under which the novel was written and why it is a masterpiece. This discussion then turns to the question of the role of educatorsâand what constitutes a competent audience. One answer to this question is whether or not literature is a style, or a collection of words. The second half of the lecture is devoted to the authorâs, a faculty or students whose contributions to the field are often overlooked.","summarize: In this first lecture on the theory of literature in social contexts, Professor Paul Fry examines the work of Mikhail Bakhtin and Hans Robert Jauss. The relation of their writing to formalist theory and the work of Barthes and Foucault is articulated. The dimensions of Bakhtinâs heteroglossia, along with the idea of common language, are explored in detail through a close reading of the first sentence of Jane AustinâsÂ.

Jamesonâs relation to the historical past is considered, as well as the ways in which he positions himself among his contemporaries. The three major themes of Jameson are 1) the rise of capitalism, 2) the idea of creative destruction, 3) the state of nature, 4) the question of what holds society together and 5) Jameson asserts that history can be affected by culture and history, rather than through words. However, this narrative is not accidental; it is based upon the artistic representations of other modernists, such as Pound, Eliot, and Cubist artisans. The poem","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores Fredric Jamesonâs seminal work,Â, as an outcropping of Marxist literary criticism and structural theory. Texts such as Shelleyâs âOde to the West Windâ and Shakespeareâs seventy-third sonnet are examined in the context of Jamesonâs three horizons of underlying interpretive frameworksâthe political, the social, and the historical, each carefully explained.

The New Historicalists were interested in the ways that historians read literature, and they often found ways to reconcile the old school with the New Historicism. However, this process of interpretation comes to a abrupt end when a critic of the New School collapses due to a series of events at the heart of the novel.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines the work of two seminal New Historicists, Stephen Greenblatt and Jerome McGann. The origins of New Historicism in Early Modern literary studies are explored, and New Historicismâs common strategies, preferred evidence, and literary sites are explored.

The purpose of the course is to examine the ways in which chemicals have affected human health and natural resources, and to evaluate their effectiveness. The government has used warnings, control over advertising, and age restrictions to regulate chemicals. The tobacco industry has been able to complicate efforts to impose stricter regulations on tobacco consumption due to its power in the media due to ad sales and government due to the importance of cigarette sales taxes to state governments.","summarize: This lecture covers site restoration law by looking at the U.S. Navyâs use of the island of Vieques as weapons testing ground. Vieques residents are filing a civil suit against the U.S. government, which raises issues of burden of proof, scientific certainty with respect to exposure amounts and health impacts, and how the government protects citizens from environmental hazards.

87,"summarize: There are several ways in which air rises and cools in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is composed of gases that are invisible to the human eye, such as temperature gradients and latent heat release as well as chloroplasts and other living things. The primary anthropogenic source of convective airway condensation is chlorofluvated cloud mass. High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are dangerous because of the damage ozone can cause to a personâs airway if it is too cold to form a storm. Weather forecasting methods such as those of tornados and kink in clouds are also discussed.","summarize: Air is able to hold a limited amount of water vapor, and that amount depends on the temperature of the air. When this saturation vapor pressure is exceeded, liquid water begins to condense and clouds form. There are several different types of clouds, some which rain and others which do not, and each with characteristics specific to it. Vortices are a particular type of cloud phenomenon in which there is a low pressure anomaly in the center of the cloud with rotating air around it, forming funnel clouds as seen in tornados. The low pressure allows liquid water to condense and form the funnel shaped cloud.

Heat tends to increase with depth in the atmosphere, which indirectly causes heat release from the sun. Another factor influencing heat release is the amount of heat being transported by fluid motion around the globe.","summarize: There is a latitudinal gradient of heat on the Earth caused by the tilt of the Earthâs axis with respect to the sun. This tilt produces seasonal fluctuations in heat input from the sun, as well as an excess of heat received on average annually near the equator. Heat is transferred poleward by both the ocean and atmosphere in an attempt to balance the Earthâs energy budget.

Temperature varies in a more complicated way with altitude in the northern and southern hemispheres. The atmosphere is surrounded by rotating flow caused by the balance between pressure differences between the pressure difference and Coriolis forces at the Earthâs boundaries. Changes in pressure lead to changes in the atmosphere, which affect which areas of the Earth are affected.","summarize: The circulation in the atmosphere is composed of three circulation cells in the northern and southern hemispheres. These cells are caused by the rotation of the Earth which creates the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force deflects northern hemisphere motion to the right and southern hemisphere motion to the left. The majority of large-scale motion in the atmosphere is in geostrophic balance, meaning the Coriolis force acting on the motion is balanced by a pressure gradient force. The rotation of cyclones and anticyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres is controlled by this geostrophic balance.",0.41340782122905023,0.15819209039548024,0.09142857142857141,0.24581005586592175,0.24581005586592175

Different areas have different climates depending on factors such as their latitude and surrounding terrain. Seasonality is affected by the amount of solar insolation received at the Earthâs surface, which varies in time due to the tilt of the Earth rotation axis. Weather forecasting also affects the composition of the atmosphere during the year, which is affected in some regions by the balance of the pressure gradient across the equator and also by the imbalance of land mass.",summarize: The seasonal cycle on Earth causes shifts in the bands of precipitation in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar front shifts between high and mid-latitudes which causes a latitudinal shift in the occurrence of frontal cyclones. The Intertropical Convergence Zone also shifts across the equator bringing bands of precipitation to different tropical regions throughout the year. Regional climates on Earth have been classified based on temperature and precipitation values. Areas affected by seasonal shifts in the ITCZ and polar front are included in this classification scheme.

The primary anthropogenic source of these currents is chlorophyll, or epoxid release at the oceanâs surface. Heat driven currents include both squall line winds and thermohaline currents. They can occur in the Arctic Ocean as well as in the oceans. Mountain ridges form offshore of South America and are composed of compacted snow that has accumulated over time. If the ice continuity is maintained when the ice sheet reaches the ocean, the ice will float on the water and this is referred to as a wind stress.","summarize: Ocean currents are generally divided into two categories: thermohaline currents and wind driven currents. Both types of currents are forced remotely rather than locally. Wind driven currents are initially forced by the wind stress causing water to pile up in certain locations. This produces a pressure gradient, which is then balanced by the Coriolis force and geostrophic currents develop. The gyre circulations found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are wind driven currents. There is a connection between the physics of these currents and the biological productivity in the ocean. For example, productivity is greatest in areas of equatorial and coastal upwelling as nutrient rich deep water is brought to the sunlit surface.",0.4588744588744589,0.1310043668122271,0.06167400881057269,0.23376623376623376,0.23376623376623376
93,"summarize: Until recently, the Earth has contained a surplus of ice. Since the Holocene epoch, this has reduced the world population to about two billion people. The amount of ice currently varies based on the amount of projected warming associated with those geological processes. Ice sheets form on mountains and glaciers and are composed of compacted snow that has accumulated over time. Mountain glaciers also have been able to impact the climate through their mass extinctions. They can become grounded in shallow water, but generally are moved by the wind stress acting on the ice surface which pushes it away from the ocean. Mountain populations also increase with depth in the Arctic Ocean. If the ice continuity is maintained through migration, more likely will be added to the mix. Mountain","summarize: Ice on earth is sensitive to climate change and ice plays a role in climate change processes. Recent trends in the Greenland ice sheet provide an important example. Over the past two decades the extent of surface melt water on the ice sheet has increased. In addition, satellites have detected a decrease in the overall mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Paleoclimate is also discussed in this lecture, with a focus on climate over the last 5 million years. The mid-Pliocene was a particularly warm period from 3.3-3 million years before present. The Pleistocene was a more recent cold period ending with the Last Glacial Maximum about 14,000 years before present.

94,"summarize: paleoclimatology occurs when the atmosphere is sufficiently cold and the gases it produces are invisible. Temperature varies with depth in the atmosphere, which affects both temperature and salinity. Ice sheets form at the boundaries of three major groups of atoms which affect each otherâs climate. They can be added to or removed from the ocean surface, or raised to the ocean. Mountain glaciers form where carbon dioxide concentration is about twice that of the day, and therefore typically require a non-zero Coriose concentration. The atmosphere is composed of water vapor that has been heated through chemical reactions.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at:Â","summarize: Isotopes are used to measure past climate properties. Deuterium and oxygen 18 are the most commonly used climate proxies. Lighter isotopes evaporate more readily from the ocean, so water vapor in the atmosphere is isotopically lighter than ocean water. This vapor gets lighter still as it is transported to higher latitudes while losing mass by precipitation. These processes leave an isotopic signal of temperature and continental ice volume in ice cores and deep sea sediment cores.",0.2594594594594595,0.07650273224043715,0.03314917127071823,0.14054054054054055,0.14054054054054055
95,"summarize: Geology and climate have shaped the development of organic chemistry tremendously. This has occurred in the form of processes such as the oxygenation of the atmosphere, mass extinctions, and disasters such as floods and volcanic eruptions. The earthâs current warming also has allowed the extraction of carbon dioxide from the ocean surface. Another important reason for the rapid warming of the Earth system is its acidity. Aerosols released during a period of hours of intense heat release can help combat the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.Â The limited amount of projected warming associated with these emissions scenarios range from about 2-4ppmv/mole. The limited projected warming of atmospheric albedo illustrates the limited","summarize: The issue of global warming is discussed. Recent climate change over the last half of the 20 century is thought to be driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide playing a large role. The carbon cycle describes the reservoirs of carbon (atmosphere, terrestrial biomass and ocean) and the exchanges that occur between these reservoirs. Inputs of carbon to the atmosphere include burning of fossil fuels and respiration from biomass. Vegetation also removes carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and a similar uptake of carbon from the atmosphere occurs in the ocean through biological processes. Residence time for carbon in the atmosphere can be computed and is estimated to be a few hundred years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has been measured directly since the 1950s",0.3884297520661157,0.1,0.01680672268907563,0.20661157024793386,0.20661157024793386
96,"summarize: The lecture reviews the energy consequences of wind energy use and the way it is measured. Wind energy is primarily used for heating, transportation, and generating electricity. It is projected that each wind energy source will produce about 800W/mv by 2050 (a 50% increase). The amount of projected energy being spent in the atmosphere will decrease dramatically with economic activity.","summarize: Renewable energy sources are discussed. These include wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy and geothermal energy. Energy from wind is acquired through the use of large wind turbines. These turbines ideally need to be located in areas where there is strong wind and low atmospheric turbulence. Solar power is collected using both photovoltaic solar cells and concentrated solar power. Energy from biomass can be produced in two ways: burning biomass to generate electricity or fermentation to produce fuel ethanol. Geothermal energy is produced by pumping water below the earthâs surface into areas of hot rocks which heats the water and creates steam. This steam is then run through a turbine to produce power.",0.36158192090395486,0.04571428571428571,0.0,0.21468926553672316,0.21468926553672316
97,"summarize: The course begins with a review of the previous experiment, which showed how temperature varies with wavelength gradients in the atmosphere. The wave function of light is used to calculate the amount of light that is being emitted from different wavelengths, such as the size of openings, the number of protons in the gas tank, and the change in radiative forcing at the Earthâs surface. The concept of uniform temperature leads to the formation of a three-stage ozone layer. The primary source of warm air rises to this temperature is chlorofluvated carbon, which is a product of chemical reactions between heat and UV radiation.","summarize: A simple model of the overall Earthâs heat budget is derived. The Earth is assumed to be in equilibrium with the input of solar radiation balanced by the output of infrared radiation emitted by the Earthâs surface. Using this model, the Earthâs surface temperature is calculated to be cooler than in reality due to the lack of an atmosphere and the greenhouse effect in the model.",0.4293785310734463,0.09142857142857143,0.023121387283236997,0.2485875706214689,0.2485875706214689
98,"summarize: Mixing, dilution and concentration of gases can cause air pollutants to increase or decrease in the atmosphere. This is achieved when a particleâs air mass is added to the air, or raised or lowered in the air. Mixing causes a change in concentration between the temperature of the earth and the solvents which are added to it. Temperature varies with the pressure gradient caused by the wind stress acting on the ozone layer which indirectly causes changes in concentration.","summarize: This lecture describes how pollutants mix in the atmosphere. Three cases are considered: confined mixing, unconfined mixing, and unconfined mixing with wind. In a confined volume, the concentration of pollutant in the air depends on the volume and the mass of the air present in the volume. Unconfined mixing is also known as diffusion, in which the pollutant disperses through the air from the source over time. When wind is considered, the pollutant disperses from the source in the direction of the wind. The change in temperature with height in the atmosphere is also discussed.",0.4406779661016949,0.12571428571428572,0.023121387283236993,0.2824858757062147,0.2824858757062147
99,"summarize: There are three main types of air pollutants in the atmosphere: heat, chlorine, and nitrogen oxides. Heat tends to rise sufficiently above the surface, chlorine tends to leach into the atmosphere through metabolic processes, which indirectly causes water vapor condensation. Temperature varies in a more complicated way with altitude in the earth system, with several counties in the USA experiencing extreme air pollution. Heat can be added to or removed from the atmosphere, and precipitation and evaporation change the temperature of the earthâs atmosphere. Surface winds also act as a forcing mechanism on the atmosphere by creating a wind stress which pushes air pollutants away from the ocean surface.","summarize: The lapse rate describes the rate at which air cools with altitude. Atmospheric stability depends on the lapse rate. When an air parcel is lifted or lowered, it can continue to rise or descend based on the temperature of the surrounding air at the new altitude, which indicates an unstable atmosphere. Inversions can occur in the atmosphere, meaning the air near the ground will be cooler than air aloft. This type of temperature profile can cause air to be trapped near the Earthâs surface in a boundary layer, which can also lead to pollutants being trapped near the ground.",0.40566037735849053,0.1142857142857143,0.038461538461538464,0.2169811320754717,0.2169811320754717

The events leading up to the Revolutionary War are discussed, as Professor Freeman explains, including the flight of a Connecticut newspaper from July 1776 to March 1776; the formation of the Loyalist group in New Haven; and the riots that summer in Watts, a poor neighborhood in Connecticut. These movements were linked to a larger national political and academic trend.","summarize: To show how Americans experienced the war and made difficult choices, Professor Freeman offers a spur-of-the-moment lecture on New Haven during the Revolution, discussing how Yale College students and New Haven townspeople gradually became caught up in the war. Warfare finally came to New Haven in July 1779 when the British army invaded the town.

101,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the myriad ways in which society during the Revolution affected the American Revolution. She notes that the increased activism of African Americans in the Revolution testified to a greater fear of violence between the British and the American colonies. In addition, women experienced extreme forms of violence as whites guaranteed the return of power, including the resurgence of the KKK, and urged the colonies to declare independence from Britain. This type of violence also caused female soldiers to revolt, often in the form of strikes, strikes, and businesses.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the experiences of African Americans, women, and Native Americans during the Revolution, framing her discussion within a larger historical debate over whether or not the Revolution was âradical.â Freeman ultimately concludes that while white American males improved their position in society as a result of the Revolution, women, African Americans, and Native Americans did not benefit in the same ways.",0.4025157232704402,0.12738853503184713,0.05161290322580645,0.25157232704402516,0.25157232704402516
102,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the Articles of Confederation. Although they seem hopelessly weak in the long view of history, the Articles made perfect sense as a first stab at American independence by a people who deeply distrusted monarchy and thought that the future of the American colonies was imminent. Yet, under the spell of Adamsâs charity and the growing national popular imagination, the new constitution was passed by the voters in 1776. Adams and many other Americans rallied behind the more radical provisions of the Articles, including President Andrew Johnson and John Adams. The picture that emerges is considerably complex and left without resolution.","summarize: This lecture discusses the ongoing political experimentation involved in creating new constitutions for the new American states. Having declared independence from Great Britain, Americans had to determine what kind of government best suited their individual states as well as the nation at large; to many, this was the âwhole objectâ of their revolutionary turmoil. Different people had different ideas about what kind of republican government would work best for their state. Should there be a unicameral or a bicameral legislature? How should political representation be organized and effected? How far should the principle of popular sovereignty be taken?",0.28019323671497587,0.03902439024390244,0.0,0.17391304347826086,0.17391304347826086

First, she discusses James Madisonâs opinion of the Constitution and his role in the drafting of the new Constitution. The issue of representation in the Constitution is considered, as well as whether the Constitution should be read aloud by the states. Second, the debate between the states and the federal government over the role of a national executive is raised. The lecture concludes with a brief discussion of the Virginia Convention and its delegates.","summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the national debate over the proposed Constitution, arguing that in many ways, when Americans debated its ratification, they were debating the consequences and meaning of the Revolution. Some feared that a stronger, more centralized government would trample on the rights and liberties that had been won through warfare, pushing the new nation back into tyranny, monarchy, or aristocracy. The Federalist essays represented one particularly ambitious attempt to quash Anti-Federalist criticism of the Constitution. In the end, the Anti-Federalists did have one significant victory, securing a Bill of Rights to be added after the new Constitution had been ratified by the states.",0.38144329896907214,0.11458333333333334,0.042105263157894736,0.21649484536082475,0.21649484536082475
104,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses how society in the American colonies developed into a nation of great power, wealth, and influence. She uses examples from colonistsâ writings to show how American colonists found a shared bond through their search for food, medicine, and religion.","summarize: Professor Freeman discusses what it meant to be a British colonist in America in the eighteenth century. She explains how American colonists had deep bonds of tradition and culture with Great Britain. She argues that, as British colonists with a strong sense of their British liberties, settlers in America valued their liberties above all else. She also explains that many Americans had a sense of inferiority when they compared their colonial lifestyles to the sophistication of Europe. Professor Freeman discusses the social order in America during the eighteenth century, and suggests that the lack of an entrenched aristocracy made social rank more fluid in America than in Europe. She ends the lecture by suggesting that the great importance that American colonists placed on British liberties and their link with Britain helped pave the way",0.24719101123595508,0.06818181818181818,0.034482758620689655,0.16853932584269662,0.16853932584269662

Professor Blight narrates the events leading up to the warâs conclusion, including the decisive loss of Alsace and Vicksburg in the Battle of Antietam, fought in September of 1862. The war is distinguished both by its military capability and its realistic portrayal of the human cost. The lecture concludes with an analysis of the loss of Wade and his wife Peggy Burden.","summarize: After finishing with his survey of the manner in which historians have explained the coming of the Civil War, Professor Blight focuses on Fort Sumter. After months of political maneuvering, the Civil War began when Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, in the harbor outside Charleston, SC. The declaration of hostilities prompted four more statesâVirginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arkansasâto secede.

Conkling, a Virginia slave whose concerted action suggests the central role American citizens played in the growing conflict between the Confederate forces and the African Americans.","summarize: This lecture focuses on the process of emancipation after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. The Proclamation, Professor Blight suggests, had four immediate effects: it made the Union army an army of emancipation; it encouraged slaves to strike against slavery; it committed the US to a policy of emancipation in the eyes of Europe; and it allowed African Americans to enlist in the Union Army. In the end, ten percent of Union soldiers would be African American. A number of factors, Professor Blight suggests, combined to influence the timing of emancipation in particular areas of the South, including geography, the nature of the slave society, and the proximity of the Union army.",0.35294117647058826,0.07920792079207921,0.010000000000000002,0.25490196078431376,0.25490196078431376

Blight begins with an introduction to the genre of slave narratives, with particular attention to Frederick Douglassâ 1845 narrative. The lecture then moves on to discuss the culture in which antebellum reform grewâthe factors that encouraged its growth, as well as those that retarded it.

108,"summarize: Professor Wrightson reviews the events leading up to the French Revolution of 1848. He argues that the rise of nationalist sentiment in France culminated ultimately with the defeat of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic. He also points out that, in many respects, the revolution was a necessary step in the development of republican political thought. The role played by various personalities in Franceâs growing dissatisfaction with the monarchy resulted in the emergence of increasingly persecuted minority populations. Ireland experienced a similar situation, although it had converted to Christianity centuries earlier. It was only through the Irish Resolves of 1884 which the Irish people were able to revolt against the British monarchy, and the eventual decline of the Irish republic in 1892","summarize: Revolutions occur when a critical mass of people come together to make specific demands upon their government. They invariably involve an increase in popular involvement in the political process. One of the central questions concerning 1848, a year in which almost every major European nation faced a revolutionary upsurge, is why England did not have its own revolution despite the existence of social tensions. Two principal reasons account for this fact: first, the success of reformist political measures, and the existence of a non-violent Chartist movement; second, the elaboration of a British self-identity founded upon a notion of respectability. This latter process took place in opposition to Britainâs cultural Other, Ireland, and",0.2892561983471074,0.03333333333333334,0.0,0.17355371900826447,0.17355371900826447
109,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freedman considers the causes of the Second World War, focusing on the so-called First World War as a moment of âracial reckoningâ½.â The human cost of the war cannot be understood only in terms of demographics. Indeed, for many French people who lived through the war, public spectacles of bereavement, such as the Unknown Soldier, are also conceived of as intensely private affairs. In considering the role of civilians in the second World War it is necessary to consider the role that soldiers played in the process of dying, and how responsibility of their individual actions should be shared with wider populations.","summarize: As a result of World War I, Europe had a different understanding of war in the twentieth century than the United States. One of the most important ways in which the First World War was experienced on the continent and in Britain was through commemoration. By means of both mass-media technologies and older memorial forms, sites of memory offered opportunities for personal as well as political reconciliation with the unprecedented consequences of the war. The influence of these sites is still felt today, in a united Europe, as the importance of armies has diminished in favor of social welfare programs.",0.3904761904761905,0.09615384615384616,0.019417475728155338,0.22857142857142856,0.22857142857142856

He notes that, throughout the history of imperial power, the tension between communist revolutionaries and socialist reformers was reconciled. This tension was voiced by the so-called New Imperialists, who wished to bear upon their figurative body the will of the French people to maintain their power in the face of a political environment characterized by the opposition between traditional forms of government and state power. It is unclear how coherent these two ideas were.","summarize: The course will concern European history from 1648 to 1945.

111,"summarize: If Europe experienced a decline in the second half of World War I, it would be impossible to understand the causes. Not only the economic, psychological, and behavioral consequences of the war, but also the nature of its alliances with Germany and other nations. Indeed, for many German citizens, the war was genuinely a moment of self-determination. However, this factor is never simply a result of the wars between France and Britain or France or Russia. It is precisely the role of national identity, nationalism, and xenophobia that played a role. In considering this question, it is important to distinguish between valuable lessons from the past and warnings from the future, and in particular to account for the diversity of peoples in Europe.","summarize: Contrary to the âGreat Illusionâ that the end of World War I heralded a new era of peace, the interwar period can be considered to form part of a Thirty Yearsâ War, spanning the period from 1914 to 1945. In the wake of the Treaty of Versailles, Europe was divided both literally and figuratively, with the so-called revisionist powers frustrated over their new borders. One of the most significant and ultimately most pernicious debates at Versailles concerned the identity of states with ethnic majorities.

He traces the origins of the organization of the American Revolution from Sumeria in 1969, to the founding of the Republic in 1979, which gave birth to the modern nation state. Communism is expressed in many ways through policies of militarization, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia. At the same time, efforts to contain the effects of these developments are being hindered by right-wing domestic political and religious forces.","summarize: The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted from a number of different factors. Three important ones are nationalism among Soviet satellite states, democratic opposition movements, and economic crisis. Along with these elements, the role of Mikhail Gorbachev should not be discounted. Although his attempt to reform communism was rejected, his reformist positions as Soviet premier helped open the way for full-fledged political dissidence. One of the major challenges faced by Europe in the wake of the collapse of communism has been that posed by ethnic nationalism, a problem that erupted violently in the Balkans in the 1990s.

114,"summarize: Professor Wrightson reviews the consequences of the British Civil War on three bases: economic dynamism, religious radicalism, and political radicalism. He notes that while it is essential to appreciate the various long-term causes of the conflict, we must also recognize the role of individuals within England in the period leading up to the war. He then focuses on the emergence of anti-Semitism within England, and the growth of xenophobia within Britain. He concludes by noting that this trend occurred despite the fact that the British faced a citizen army comprised of highly motivated soldiers with diverse aims and viewpoints. It should therefore be noted that the success of these efforts must have been uneven across the country, and that many chose to be Loyalists","summarize: Several reasons can be found to explain why Great Britain and the Netherlands did not follow the other major European powers of the seventeenth century in adopting absolutist rule. Chief among these were the presence of a relatively large middle class, with a vested interest in preserving independence from centralized authority, and national traditions of resistance dating from the English Civil War and the Dutch war for independence from Spain, respectively. In both countries anti-absolutism formed part of a sense of national identity, and was linked to popular anti-Catholicism.

115,"summarize: Peter the Great, crowned emperor in 1688, moved his capitol from Russia to the newly-built city of Petersburg in 1779. The impetus for the expansion of Russia into Asia was to protect its national power through alliances with other nations, including Sweden and Russia. Peterâs ability to link himself with the divine through his characteristic flight around the globe, coupled with his uncanny talent for diplomacy, and his diffuse anger against perceived decadence, cemented a division between Russia and Europe that has persisted into the twenty-first century.","summarize: Peter the Greatâs historical significance stems not only from his military ambitions and the great expansion of the Russian Empire under his supervision, but also from his efforts to introduce secular, Western customs and ideas into Russian culture. Despite his notorious personal brutality, Peterâs enthusiasm for science and modern intellectual concerns made an indelible mark both on Russiaâs relationship to the West and on its internal politics. The struggle under Peterâs reign between Westernizers and Slavophiles, or those who resist foreign influences, can be seen at work in Russia up to the present day.",0.3263157894736842,0.06382978723404255,0.021505376344086023,0.1894736842105263,0.1894736842105263
116,"summarize: This lecture traces the development of the Enlightenment, the organization of which was largely based on the ideas of Thomas Jefferson and John Stuart Mill. It is important to see these thinkers in contrast to their modernist predecessors. Although they may be related to one another, they belong to a long list of thinkers of the seventeenth-century Enlightenment. Professor Freeman discusses how the creation of the French Enlightenment inspired legal and social movements such as the Code of Liberty, the equal liberty of individuals, and the fundamental equality of religion.","summarize: While the major philosophical projects of the Enlightenment are associated with the names of individual thinkers such as Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, the cultural transformation in France in the years leading up to the Revolution should also be understood in the context of the public sphere and popular press. Alongside such luminaries as those associated with DiderotâsÂ Â were a host of lesser pamphleteers and libellists eager for fame and some degree of fortune.

117,"summarize: The early years of the twentieth century witnessed a rise of violence, rather than revolution, in France. In many respects, this violence is a necessary step in the development of political and social change. Along with the fact that the French people believed in changing the Revolution through legal action, however, it is important not to simply ignore the role of capital punishment. Indeed, many French people were determined to believe that the defeat of the Revolution was the result of a popular will. These feelings heightened with the Revolutionâs general acceptance.","summarize: Robespierreâs ascetic personal life and severe philosophy of political engagement are attributed by some to his difficult childhood. As a revolutionary, one of his most significant insights was that the Revolution was threatened not only by Franceâs military adversaries abroad, but also by domestic counter-revolutionaries. Under this latter heading were gathered two major groups, urban mercantilists and rural peasants. Relative strength of religious commitment is the major factor in explaining why some regions of France rose up in defense of the monarchy while others supported the Revolution.",0.2810810810810811,0.06557377049180328,0.011049723756906077,0.16216216216216214,0.16216216216216214

The latterâs struggle to link himself with the national identity of France during the Revolution is considered as a harbinger of the new political and social tensions that will continue to rage throughout the years. The Thirty Years Peace was negotiated, and the eventual defeat of the French forces by Napoleon at the Battle of Poitiers.","summarize: One way of understanding Napoleonâs life is through attention to his Corsican origins. Although Napoleon himself would later disavow his earlier identification with the island in favor of French identity, many of his actions and attitudes agree with stereotypical notions of Corsican culture. Did Napoleon inaugurate the era of total war? This question, posed in a recent book, is up for debate. On one hand, the violence of the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars may not seem uniquely devastating in comparison to the ravages of the Thirty Yearsâ War. On the other hand, the faltering of distinctions between civilian and combatant as well as the large-scale mobilization of state resources for war",0.37634408602150543,0.07608695652173914,0.010989010989010988,0.2473118279569893,0.2473118279569893

The context of the development of Islam is given and key features, such as the Mosaic law of worship, the founding of the nation, and the introduction of true religion. The second half of the lecture introduces the question of âwhat constitutes good citizenship?â  and how does it come to be chosen by God? The first half reviews the history of early modern Islam and a few features that made the rise of Islam a household state, emphasizing the piety of individuals and community rather than the individual, but also fundamental changes in values and practices raised by Islam.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freedman introduces Islam. He begins with a discussion of its geographical context: the dry desert lands of the Arabian peninsula. The Bedouins, or nomadic Arabs of the region, lived in a tribal society somewhat similar to the Germanic tribes discussed earlier in the course.Â Their raids against the Byzantine and the Persian Empire, for lack of strong opposition, would lead to the Arab conquests.

120,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freedman considers the various factors that may have contributed to the rise of the Islamic Caliphate, as well as the manner in which it was defended from invading armies. The Caliphate had a highly religious character compared to that of the Roman Empire, but converted to Christianity centuries earlier. At the same time, the Caliphate helped shape the face of Europe, and created a state characterized by a strong administration and well-organized tax system. However, the state sponsored a cultural flowering, based in part on the translation of classical Greek and Roman texts. This factor influence the rule of the Caliphate and also the role of the local elite, which ruled the territory of Al-Arian, or","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the Islamic conquests.Â Although they were in some sense religiously motivated, Arab did not attempt to forcibly convert or eradicate Jews, Christians, or other non-Muslims.Â The conquests began as raids, but quickly escalated when the invaders discovered that Byzantium and Persia were too weak to withstand their assault. In a relatively short period of time, the Arabs were able to conquer an area stretching from Spain to India.Â Against this background of successful conquests, Islam began to experience deep internal divisions. These began as criticisms of the election of Mohammedâs successors, but broadened to criticize the Caliphate and the ruling family.Â Out of this",0.34745762711864403,0.09401709401709402,0.043103448275862065,0.22881355932203393,0.22881355932203393
121,"summarize: Professor Freedman considers the crisis that took place in the fifth century. The crisis caused the Roman Empire to fall apart from its old position, and the decline of the Mediterranean world.Â Increasingly faced with external threats â particularly the Viking invasions, the Empire helped shape the face of Europe. In the absence of strong social infrastructure and an idea of loyalty to the ruler, government servants strove to make their positions hereditary and nobles sought to set up independent kingdoms.Â However, under pressure from their old enemy, Persia, and new threats, these Slavs and Avars in the West and Arabs in the East, many of whom were displaced by Christianity.Â Internally, these developments seem","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freedman surveys major trends in Byzantine history from the sixth to eleventh century, dividing the era into four periods.In the sixth century, under Justinianâs rule, the Byzantine Empire experienced a period of expansion (532-565).Â However, the Empire was unable to hold on to Justinianâs hard won territories and so contracted for over a century of crisis that threatened its survival (565-717).Â In the next period, (717-843), the Byzantine army was reorganized and the Empire was able to regain some lost territory.Â At the same time, the empire was wracked by the conflicts accompanying",0.3287671232876712,0.055299539170506916,0.0,0.1917808219178082,0.1917808219178082
122,"summarize: Professor Wrightson reviews public health strategies in the period leading up to the outbreak of cholera in England. He notes how these strategies attempted to address the social and economic consequences of the disease, including the development of effective regulation of tobacco use, and the introduction of public health as a public purpose. The success of these efforts was uneven across the country and largely depended on whether individual citizens were exposed to specific forms of harm, which could have been spread by infected material or by physical factors. Government support for these measures also played a role, particularly in urban areas, was greatly influenced by the economic factors of poverty and unsanitary living conditions. Professor Walshell also provides an overview of the campaigns and policies of the affected","summarize: The sanitary movement was an approach to public health first developed in England in the 1830s and â40s. With increasing industrialization and urbanization, the removal of filth from towns and cities became a major focus in the struggle against infectious diseases. As pioneered by Edwin Chadwick, the sanitary movement also embraced an explicit political objective, according to which urban cleansing took on a figurative as well as a literal sense, and was seen as a potential solution to the threat posed by the âdangerous classes.â European cities followed suit, with Paris and Naples embarking on wholesale rebuilding projects, necessitating large-scale state intervention.

123,"summarize: An examination of the tuberculosis movement from the 1890s to the 1950s shows how the development of scientific proof of the disease linked tuberculosis to international issues including colonialism, the spread of Christianity, and the development process. The suspicion of willful human agency in spreading tuberculosis was considered by many to be a form of imperialism. Tuberculosis also had a significant impact on European culture. In the U.S., early public health attempts at understanding and combating the disease were hindered by economic and religious forces. Tuuberculosis also played a role in poor diets and unsanitary living conditions. Poor air quality and cramped living conditions increased susceptibility to the disease, which greatly reduced public health efforts.","summarize: The cultural transition from the romantic era of consumption to the era of tuberculosis derived not only from the germ theory of disease and the triumph of contagionism over anticontagionism, but also from political considerations. Worries over population decline and growing working-class militancy were aggravated by what now appeared to be a social disease, or a disease of poverty. One of the strategies deployed against the disease was the sanatorium, an institution which was capable both of instructing patients in contagionism and in imposing a practical quarantine. Although the development of effective chemotherapy in the 1940s raised hopes that tuberculosis might be globally eradicated, these have unfortunately proven to be overly optimistic.

124,"summarize: Community responses to the bubonic plague ranged from the flight of a privileged few to widespread panic and the persecution of foreigners and other stigmatized social groups. The suspicion of willful human agency in spreading the disease, identified with the work of poisoners, is a major source of anxiety. Mass religious revivals also accompanied the pandemic, with the emergence of new cults of saints and public forms of repentance. Official attempts to contain the second pandemic resulted in the first full-scale public health program, the plague regulations instituted by the Italian city-states, regulations that included military quarantines, compulsory burial, and imprisonment of infected individuals.","summarize: One of the major cultural consequences of the second plague pandemic was its effect on attitudes towards death and the âart of dying.â As a result both of its extreme virulence and the strictness of the measures imposed to combat it, plague significantly disrupted traditional customs of dealing with death. This disruption made itself felt not only in religious belief and burial practices but also in art, architecture and literature.

125,"summarize: Professor Snowden describes the impact of smallpox upon the human body. The impact of the disease on humans is considered, as well as the possible motivations for its emergence. The difficulty to control smallpox was underscored by the experience of epidemic diseases such as Pinatubo in 1991. The dread of small-pox was a result of its agonizing and unpleasant symptoms, which, in the case of the Americas, often left victims permanently disfigured. In addition, smallpox had a curiously twofold effect: it spread through the oral ingestion of fecund matter, which is a major source of virulence, and its overwhelming predilection for the poor. The second effect of inoculation was to reduce the spread of","summarize: It is not known for certain when smallpox first appeared in Europe; however, the disease reached its highpoint in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it persisted as an endemic disease while periodically erupting as an epidemic. European literature testifies to the pervasiveness of smallpox, a disease that most would have had acquired in childhood. In the New World, the disease was experienced very differently. With no acquired immunities on the part of native populations, European explorers and colonists were responsible for devastating âvirgin soil epidemics,â one consequence of which was to pave the way for the importation of African slaves.

He highlights the ânature of foodâ½� phenomenon of drinking, which he describes as the primary source of food before World War I. He also touches on the myth of the flight of a kirkir, a flight hazard, and the issue of whether people were rational about eating food before war. He responds to these questions through a number of examples.","summarize: Because drinking is such an integral part of French culture, alcohol abuse has been historically ignored. Although there have been celebrated attempts to address this problem, such as Zola, it is only in the past five or ten years that the government has seriously tried to tackle the problem of alcoholism. One of the major ways in which alcohol is embedded in the cultural identity of the country is the close association of certain wines and liquors with their regions of production.

127,"summarize: The carnage of World War I in France in the summer of 1916, fought in trenches and on the home front, can be charted through three main lines of reasoning: anti-Semitism and xenophobia. The first line of reasoning involves trench warfare, with trenches being cut out of the German defensive wall. The second line is propaganda, as well as human response. In the case of Germany, this propaganda tool seems to have been a form of government censorship, but the fact that the domestic front was so dense that even after the warâs defeat, many French civilians were struggling with it.","summarize: The sacred union that united Franceâs political parties during World War I contributed to a resilient morale on the home front. Germanyâs invasion of France, and the conflict over Alsace-Lorraine in particular, contributed to French concern over atrocities and the national investment in the war effort.

Not only the carnage of World War I, but also the nature of its alliances would have been difficult to imagine. Indeed, in 1900 many people would have predicted conflict, rather than collaboration, between France and Britain. The reasons for the eventual decline of France and Germany are still unclear.","summarize: 1917 is a critical moment in World War I, as the Bolsheviks seize power in Russia and Woodrow Wilson leads the U.S. into war on the side of the Allied powers. Although morale held steady on the home front in France, there were multiple mutinies and strikes as the war progressed.

129,"summarize: Anti-Semitism in France after World War II has historically been directed toward the U.S. government and corporations rather than American citizens. In the case of Vietnam, this resentment is often directed towards the French government and the establishment of rightwing politics within France. Along with the history of American imperialism, however, it has also been argued that this factor should be noted that the communist Left represented a minority group. One such instance of this type of radicalism occurred in December of 1958, when the OAS under Napoleon III and his wife Charles de Gaulle launched a campaign of violence against the French soldiers in the city of Verdun, an act of invasion which resulted in the death of dozens of French soldiers.","summarize: Franceâs colonial territories were of very high importance after the embarrassment of occupation during World War II.

While reformist socialists believed in changing the State through legal activity, revolutionary socialists viewed such measures as ineffective and perhaps even complicit in maintaining the status quo. Along with the history of syndicalism, however, syndicalists and anarchists shared the conviction that the State could not be reformed from within. This conviction would find a ready outlet in the form of strikes, strikes, and other forms of political action. It would also radicalize many socialists to the cause of revolution, and it would only be able to accomplish this goal if the workers remained behind the barricades. Eventually, a young anarchist would realize that the working classes","summarize: The history of socialism in France can be understood in terms of the competition between revolutionary socialists and reform socialists. The former advocated abandoning electoral politics, while the latter attempted to improve conditions for workers by means of reforms within the political system.

It is unclear to what extent this crisis, while representative of the Popular Front government of Leon Blum, can be understood in terms of two well-known figures in Franceâs early twentieth century. First, the defeat of the Fascists by the victorious Charles de Gaulle marked the official end of the Third Republic, a decline realized at the hands of the civilians themselves. Second, the emergence of the Whig and Tory parties would shape the face of Europe, and if they could suppress the voices of the popular imagination, would","summarize: Two of the major crises of nineteenth-century France, the Boulanger Affair and the Dreyfus Affair, can be understood in terms of the rising forces of anti-Semitism and Far Right politics.

The pilgrim is faced with the consequences of his poetic vocation when he descends to the circle of lust (Â V), where Francesca da Rimini, in her failure to distinguishÂ Â from reality, testifies to the dangers inherent to the act of reading. From the destructive power of lust within the private world of the court, Dante moves on to the effects of its sister sin,",0.3185840707964602,0.02678571428571428,0.0,0.20353982300884957,0.20353982300884957

The story of the pilgrimâs encounter with his great-great grandfather brings to the fore the relationship between history, allegory, and philosophy. The Christian love story of Francesca welcomes Dante to the alter ego of the Medusa, where the souls of righteous rulers assume the form of a rose, the emblem of the Roman Empire, and the allegorical mode of worship. The novelty of the Christian love tradition is tied to its relationship with classical antiquity.

An impasse at the entrance to the City of Dis marks Virgilâs first failure in his role as guide (Â IX). The invocation of Medusa by the harpies that descend while they wait for divine aid elicits Danteâs first address to the reader. The question of literary mediation, posed in the previous lecture in the context ofÂ Â V, is explored further, and the distinction Dante draws between the âallegory of poetsâ and the âallegory of theologiansâ�",0.3455497382198953,0.05291005291005291,0.0,0.2408376963350785,0.2408376963350785
139,"summarize: This lecture deals with Danteâs representation of the divine inÂ Â XII. In Canto XII, Dante enters the Heaven of Jupiter, where Virgil proclaims his will to redeem the souls of righteous rulers, destroying the wicked (understood as otherwise) by profaning the temple. The contrast between doctrinal and ethical perspectives in Beatrice and Don Quixoteâ, Professor Mazzotta reveals, is predicated on Danteâ½-century prophecy that states that the good master will be punished for everyday incidents of immorality, such as the plague, which afflicts St. Dominic and St. Peter. The following cantos are also discussed, illustrating the contrast","summarize: This lecture focuses on the middle zone of Inferno, the area of violence (Â XII-XVI). Introductory remarks are made on the concentration of hybrid creatures in this area of Hell and followed by a close reading of cantos XIII and XV. The pilgrimâs encounter with Pier delle Vigne (Â XIII) is placed in literary context (Â III). The questioning of authority staged in this scene resurfaces in the circle of sodomy (Â XV), where the pilgrimâs encounter with his teacher, Brunetto Latini, is read as a critique of the humanistic values he embodied.",0.33333333333333337,0.031578947368421054,0.010638297872340425,0.17708333333333331,0.17708333333333331

The pilgrimâs encounter with his great-great grandfather brings to the fore the relationship between history, love and evil. This relationship is further marked by Danteâ seeming inability to recollect any of the events ofÂ Â XXIV-XXVI. The presence of classical mythological figures such as St. Peter and ClavileÃ±a in these cantos also raises issues regarding the role of God in human history. The novelty of the divine being in this cantos is here tied to the relationship among humans, particularly the three temptations posed by Lucifer. The problem of divine retributive","summarize: This lecture deals primarily with Cantos XIX and XXVI ofÂ. Simony, the sin punished inÂ Â XIX, is situated historically to point out the contiguity of the sacred and the profane and its relevance to the prophetic voice Dante established in this canto. The fine line between prophecy and profanation is shown to resurface inÂ Â XXIV and XXV, where the poet falls prey, as did the pilgrim inÂ Â IV, to poetic hubris.

141,"summarize: Professor Mazzotta focuses on the cantos of Cosa Transitoria (Â XXVII). The quest for freedom begun under the aegis of Cato inÂ Â XXVI is pursued by Dante, who also envisions other cities joining the Caliphate in the worship of the angels. Underlying both is the narrative secrecy of Don Quixoteâs fate, and the allegorical narrative of his oft-cited ancestor, Ulysses. InÂ XXXVI, Dante enters the city of Palestrina, opening up the Christian economy of civic polytheism to medieval notions of asceticism and divine justice. Beatrice welcomes Dante into the City of Corinth, where the","summarize: Professor Mazzotta begins this lecture by recapitulating the ambivalent nature of Ulyssesâ sin and its relevance to Danteâs poetic project.Â Â XXVII is then read in conjunction with the preceding canto. The antithetical relationship between Danteâs false counselors, Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro, anchors an overarching discussion of the relationship between rhetoric and politics.

142,"summarize: The growth of populations is held in check by several factors. These can include predators, food and other resources, and density. Population density affects climate as well as natural selection. Among these issues, population levels have been increasing steadily over the past forty years and are increasing more rapidly now. The human population has increased dramatically over this period and we cannot predict its continued increase. The impacts of population growth on humans and wildlife also seem to impact the depletion of wild lands.","summarize: World population will continue to rise until at least 2050. Environmental impact is the product of the number of people and how much of their income and technology is devoted to either consumption or conservation. So far, the balance is far at the consumption end and, globally, environmental problems are increasing. Environmentalism has not come close to counteracting the footprint of a billion extra people every dozen years. The only massive success has been the decline in global fertility. People want fewer children, the contraceptive technology is available, and the cost is minimal. The only realistic possibility for ameliorating the environmental crisis might be to facilitate the continued decline of fertility.",0.24365482233502533,0.010256410256410256,0.0,0.16243654822335024,0.16243654822335024
143,"summarize: Africa is agriculturally very rich, but because of the number of births and deaths of children it is unclear how likely is it that a family will have a child. One recent study has shown that family planning programs have little impact unless the population is well-suited to a particular religion. However, farming allows individuals to bear a larger reproductive burden of child bearing, and can encourage the development of tribes to further increase their fertility.","summarize: In many regions, the central cultural idea is that of a lineage, a family and its line of male ancestors and descendants. The prime duty in these cultures is to keep the lineage going. Religion is small scale with the ancestors performing many of the functions of gods. Denser populations and larger political entities lead to large-scale religion where conformity is stressed and cultural rules are codified in a book and not subject to discussion with the ancestors. In pre-modern Sub-Saharan Africa, land was not limiting, so a maximum number of children was desired. Neither monogamy nor chastity were valued as much as fertility.

144,"summarize: Professor Freedman continues his discussion of the bubonic plague in 1665. The reason for the intense fear provoked by the disease was threefold: because of its overwhelming predilection for fecal matter, it is impossible to eat food, drinking water, and discussing the issue of diet.Â At the same time, he points out that there were many different explanations for the disease, which could have been explained by the rise of Christianity. One interpretation is that people literally randomize over their choices of food, which consequently renders eating impossible. This view is reinforced by the theory of food safety, which states that food does not adversely affect human health.","summarize: European populations grew only slowly during the period 1200-1700; factors include disease and wars. Human feces and rotting animal remains were not sequestered and often contaminated drinking water. Cities were so filthy that more people died in them than were born. About a third of children died in infancy, many from abandonment and lack of care during wet-nursing. Children that survived were subjected to harsh discipline to control their tendency to sin.

145,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses two factors that have contributed to the global population increase of the past forty years: increased population and resources. One, the need for new farmland; and the third, the growth of populations which would benefit from a higher national income. This factor is evident in many cases in countries like Botswana and the Caliphate. By 1875, population was growing at almost 90 million a year; an increase would push the population even greater, but then it would slow. Fertility declined rapidly in the 1970s, but to counter momentum, the world population now appears to be growing faster than exponentially. A large population would logically follow from any other direction, but growth would not only occur racially, but also occur socially","summarize: Prior to Malthus, population growth was seen as good for the power and wealth of a country. The rapid population growth of America was crucial in expelling England (via the Revolution) and France (via the Louisiana Purchase) from the US. But in fact, the numbers of the poor were growing in Europe in the 1700s. Malthus argued that poverty was due to an imbalance between people and resources; since population could rise very fast, it could always outstrip any gains in productivity. He did not anticipate an exponential increase in production or a voluntary decrease in fertility. However, Malthusâ thinking is still important because high population levels and environmental limitations are in fact problematic today.",0.3583333333333334,0.033613445378151266,0.0,0.18333333333333332,0.18333333333333332
146,"summarize: The fertility rate in China after the death of motherhood was very high. However, this resulted in a number of problems. One of these problems was low fertility because of the fact that girls did not have much control over their fertility. Another issue was family planning. In addition, fertility levels rose steadily with age, but to counter momentum, female infanticide started to increase. Non-marital childbearing dropped drastically in China in the 1970s, but still high fertility today. Nevertheless, fertility has now risen to over 1.3 billion a year. There are about 80 million people worldwide. It is likely that more children will be added to the population. Such growth would greatly influence fertility.","summarize: Prior to the Demographic Transition, fertility in northwestern Europe was controlled by limiting marriage. Marriage was regulated by landowners and the churches, and was not allowed unless a man had accumulated the resources necessary to support a family. Long periods of being landless, a servant, or an apprentice, precluded marriage. Once married, there was no control of fertility. But, only about half of adults were married at any given time, so fertility was about half of what it might have been. Eventually, contraception was accepted and fertility within marriage fell. Society no longer needed to control marriage so tightly and marriage rates rose dramatically. The options of marriage, sex and childbearing passed from community control to individual control.

The body theory states that a person retains or rejects his or her body so long as he or she does so with the same body. The main objection raised to this claim is whether or not it is the best thing to do given the phenomena of dying. The lecture then turns to the brain, where John Stuart Mill suggests that Jonesâs weakness in the body view may lie in his weakness of the will. In response to this argument, Professor Gendler suggests that there are two ways in which thinking about mental identity may help us to certain conclusions.","summarize: Two more views regarding the metaphysical key to personal identity are discussed: the body view and the personality view.

The most important thing about these are the questions of why it is desirable to die, and how it may be best to refuse to face the facts about our mortality. The lecture then turns to the valuable container theory, which posits that what matters in life is being alive.

The emphasis here is on the fact that we need to believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will.

She then discusses the issue of government by looking at two major sources, First, justice in acquiring property and then justice in securing property. The lecture then turns to John Rawls as a general theory of justice, which holds that individuals must be responsible for the acquisition of property using their labor or other means.

He argues that because we are relational and not static, we must be able to sense the presence of things we cannot see so as to explain something else which is generally agreed to take place. This theme is explored further via a psychological analysis of Gage Hirsch, a Virginia schoolteacher whose personal identity is discussed in detail. At the end of his lecture, he answers several questions from students about why thinking is better than reason.","summarize: Professor Gendler reviews four instances of intrapersonal divisions that have appeared in philosophy, literature, psychology, and neuroscience: Platoâs division between reason, spirit, and appetite; Humeâs division between reason and passion; Freudâs division between id, ego, and superego; and four divisions discussed by Jonathan Haidt (mind/body, left brain/right brain, old brain/new brain, and controlled/automatic thought).

He argues that the development of black-rooted Indians was closely linked to an increased concentration of power among ethnic groups. This process is often said to have been entirely overshadowed by the growth of other ethnic groups, such as whites, blacks, and others. In fact, many of these developments were inspired by the economic preconditions of modern society, including a low social status, low productivity, and a high proportion of women. One reason for this was their ability to earn a wage, raise family wealth, and access to education. caste is also a factor in poor rural Indiansâ","summarize: Professor Rae discusses Aravind Adigaâs novel.

The definition of a calorie and how it is measured are also discussed, as well as peopleâs changing relationships with macronutrients and micronutrients in food and with water.",0.372093023255814,0.07874015748031497,0.031999999999999994,0.20155038759689922,0.20155038759689922
189,"summarize: This lecture concludes the discussion of the apocalyptic literature of the Hebrew Bible. The prophets denounced the wickedness of the nation and urged Israel to respect and live by the covenant concluded between God and Israel. However, the book of Jonah contains many features of the ancient Near Eastern community, including a strong emphasis on Godâs chosen people and chosen city, an exilic sense of Israelite mission that seeks to reach gentiles through acts of idolatry and human suffering. This lecture also includes a reference to the Book of Daniel, which contains passages of wisdom and encouragement for biblical interpretation.","summarize: In this lecture, two final books of the Bible are examined and their attitudes towards foreign nations compared. In contrast to Danielâs reliance on divine intervention to punish the wicked, the book of Esther focuses on human initiative in defeating the enemies of Israel. Finally, the book of Jonahâin which the wicked Assyrians repent and are spared divine punishmentâexpresses the view that God is compassionate and concerned with all creation. Professor Hayes concludes the course with remarks regarding the dynamic and complex messages presented in the Hebrew Bible.",0.39175257731958757,0.10416666666666667,0.042105263157894736,0.21649484536082475,0.21649484536082475
190,"summarize: This lecture introduces students to the material that will be covered in the course of the semester. Course readings and requirements are also discussed. The Bible is not a text of ancient times, and its prophets are not alike in their answers or interpretations. The Gospel of Matthew illustrates how the Bible writer skillfully crafts a narrative in order to deliver a message. It is a message that emphasizes the necessity of suffering before glory, and it is associated with a moral mission that seeks to reach gentiles.","summarize: This course approaches the New Testament not as scripture, or a piece of authoritative holy writing, but as a collection of historical documents. Therefore, students are urged to leave behind their pre-conceived notions of the New Testament and read it as if they had never heard of it before. This involves understanding the historical context of the New Testament and imagining how it might appear to an ancient person.",0.3499999999999999,0.02531645569620253,0.0,0.2125,0.2125
191,"summarize: The Apocalypse, or the Revelation of John, shares many of the traits found in apocalyptic literature: it refers to the apostles as representing a prior generation, yet it quotes from texts later excluded (perhaps, for example, 1 Thessalonians) from the Canon. It also heavily emphasizes the authority held by those with these titles, and its concern for the poor. In Romans 2 Corinthians Paul is concerned with controversies that have been dividing the church, most probably along social status lines. The issues causing controversy include whether one should eat food sacrificed to idols, how one ought to conduct oneself sexually, and how oneâs beliefs will be interpreted.","summarize: The Apocalypse of John showed an anti-Roman, politically revolutionary perspective. This is in contrast with Paulâs writing in Romans 13, which calls for submission to governmental authorities - although passages in 1 Corinthians may be said to contradict this. 2 Thessalonians, a pseudonymous letter, also preaches a politically conservative and accommodative message, as does 1 Peter. Interestingly, these letters do not discard or ignore apocalypticism but use it quite differently from the author of Revelation to further their message of political conservatism. 2 Peter seems to be a letter dating from the second century, from the post-apostolic age. In 2 Peter, the apocalypse is no longer imminent and is not",0.3423423423423424,0.05454545454545454,0.009174311926605505,0.15315315315315317,0.15315315315315317
192,"summarize: Professor Freedman considers the emergence of Israelite religion in the second half of the second century. He argues that this growth occurred primarily due to the persecution of Jewish nationals in the third and fourth centuries. However, he also points out that throughout the history of early Christianity, suffering causes have tended to be gentiles rather than Puritans. This period also saw a significant increase in written literature, including the Epistle of Jude can be dated to somewhere during the 2Â c. BCE. Jews also began to believe that Jesus was the prophet, a belief that seemed to be confirmed through redaction writing.","summarize: How did a small group following an apocalyptic prophet in Palestine become Christianity - what is now called a âworld religionâ? This small movement saw many changes in the second, third, and fourth centuries, from the development of different sects, philosophical theologies, and martyrology, to the rise of monasticism, and finally to the ascension of Constantine to the throne and the Christian Roman Empire. It was not until the nineteenth century, however, that the term âworld religionâ came to be used and Christianity was categorized as such.",0.3664921465968587,0.08465608465608465,0.03208556149732621,0.23036649214659685,0.23036649214659685
193,"summarize: The Gospel of Luke contains many features similar to those in Matthew, including a strong emphasis on prayer and interpretation. However, the Gospel also reflects a sectarian nature according to which Jesus is divine. It quotes passages from gentiles and other non-Christians as well as figures in gentilesâ especially the figure of St. Jude. The gospel also heavily emphasizes the authority held by those with these prophecies. The author of the Gospel assures the gentiles that they already possess all the benefits of salvation and do not need to observe rules concerning feast days, Sabbaths, and worship.","summarize: Luke and Acts, a two-volume work, are structured very carefully by the author to outline the ministry of Jesus and the spread of the Gospel to the gentiles. The Gospel of Luke emphasizes the themes of Jesusâ Jewish piety, his role as a rejected prophet, and the reversal of earthly status. The Gospel ends in Jerusalem, and the Acts of the Apostles begins there and then follows the spread of the Gospel, both conceptually and geographically, to Samaria and the gentiles. By closely analyzing the Gospel and Acts, we see that the author was not concerned with historicity or chronological order. Rather, he writes his âorderly accountâ",0.3942307692307692,0.10679611650485436,0.02941176470588235,0.23076923076923078,0.23076923076923078
194,"summarize: This lecture begins with a discussion of Marxâs transition from being a methodological materialist to an evolutionary materialist. The shift from naturalism to deontology is traced by Feuerbach, who argues that studying history helps us to better understand ourselves in order to formulate our theories of historical change. In addition, he relates these ideas to the problems of falsifiability, variability, and emotional contagion raised by modern society. These problems are addressed along with whether or not we can change the world.","summarize: Today we cover the transition from the young Marx, with his emphasis on change and action, to the mature Marx who turns toward positivist science and determinism, arguing that capitalism will have to fail. Through a closer look at Marxâs âTheses on Feuerbach,â we discuss different theories of truth with attention to the questions of where truth resides (in the subject, in the object, or some combination), how we know it, and how we know when we know it. Arguing for his conception of materialism, Marx argues that truth is not simply the reflection of the object in the mind of the subject; we must access truth",0.33333333333333337,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.17708333333333334,0.17708333333333334
195,"summarize: Along with Marx, Nietzsche and Weber agree on two crucial points: they argue that class is a new kind of intellectual developmentâin the form of creative destructionâand also argues that class does not come from thoughts, which is often deemed paradoxical. However, this argument is seriously challenged when compared with Marxâ and other modernists. Along with being a methodological collectivist, Weber has been able to show that class comes from experience, rather than material substance, and that Communism comes from material substance. In addition, he has shown that individuals have more or less identical ideas about value and material substance than do we. We must therefore subject our assumptions to critical scrutiny.","summarize: Max Weber wrote his best-known work after he recovered from a period of serious mental illness near the turn of the twentieth century. After he recovered, his work transitioned from enthusiastically capitalist and liberal in the tradition of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill to much more skeptical of the down-sides of modernization, more similar to the thinking of Nietzsche and Freud. In his first major work,, Weber argues that the Protestant faith, especially Lutherâs notion of âcallingâ and the Calvinist belief in predestination set the stage for the emergence of the capitalist spirit. With his more complex understanding of the causes of capitalism, Weber accounts for the motivations of",0.20087336244541484,0.026431718061674006,0.0,0.1222707423580786,0.1222707423580786
196,"summarize: We return to Weberâs idea of legal-rational authority and how it structures business decisions. First, we discuss the importance of his theory of law in understanding society and why it allows for certain types of regulation, including government regulatory agencies, courts, and university administration. We note some substantive reasons for why a lack of regulation leads to a slow and ineffective regulation process. This discussion ends with a brief summary of Weberâ½i-century political thought.","summarize: The purest formâthe ideal typeâof Weberâs legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens",0.29015544041450775,0.06282722513089005,0.010582010582010581,0.19689119170984454,0.19689119170984454
197,"summarize: GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a starts referring to the end of Part I, which is essentially a continuation of Cervantesâ moment as a writer, but this time it is devoted to the resolution of the problem of the historical conflict. The central character Don Quixote has been resurrected by his ancestor, having conquered the Spanish with his victory at the Battle of Poitiers. Now he displays his deepened wisdom in the counsel to his squire on how to govern the world through his letters, which are not for profit reasons, but rather because they represent a change in society and will eventually lead to the formation of the new Copernican republic. Don Quiquote","summarize: GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a starts by commenting on three of the returns and repetitions (characters who reappear and incidents that, if not repeated, recall previous incidents) that take place at the end of part one of theÂ Â and which give density to the fiction: the galley slaves, AndrÃ©s, and the postprandial speech or the speech on arms and letters. Don Quixoteâs insanity not only gives him a certain transcendence, but also shows the arbitrariness of laws, which causes their rejection by society and other charactersâ insane behavior.

198,"summarize: In Part II of theÂ, Professor Amy Hungerford discusses the development of the novel from a small, contained detail, to the realistic portrayal of its characters in Part I. She points out how the plot of the romances of chivalry is closely read, pointing out that Don Quixoteâs relationship with his inferiors is predicated on cuts and crisscrossing made possible by the copying of classical Greek caryatids. In part two of the Second part of the course consists of a discussion of the Baroque phenomenon, which appears to have occurred in part through the Medieval period. At the same time, it is important to see these expansions, both consciously cultivated and subconscious","summarize: Commentary of the key concepts of Spanish Baroque,Â, introduces GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­aâs suggestion that the plot of theÂ Â follows a Baroque unfolding from deceit () to disillusionment (). The discussion of Don Quixote and Sancho about knight-errants and saints is not only about arms and letters, but about good actions for their own sake and for the sake of glory (or deceit). This discussion echoes the religious debates of the time and shows Don Quixoteâs broad knowledge of them, anticipating Part IIâs projection beyond Spain.

199,"summarize: GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a starts out by commenting on the episode of Camachoâs marriage with Don Quixote, which may well be seen as a representation of the whole first part of theÂ. The episode also shows the tensions between Cervantes and Auerbach regarding the role of sensual desire in the story. The suspicion that the adulterous love story is a harbinger of the modern society, he points out that there are many things that are missing from the Bible, which is why we approach the end by returning to the beginning. The irony, however, is that this perverse love story seems more profound than the true love story. GonzÃ","summarize: The loose format of the Â allows for the incorporation of different stories and texts, such as the Camachoâs wedding, which was going to be a play. The episode, a form of epithalamium based on the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, states one of the main themes of part two, that art corrects nature. As a way of turning deceit, which would normally lead to disillusionment, into a happy ending, in Camachoâs wedding episode art helps nature to attain good ending. GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a claims that in this episode there is a subtext in which marriage is not only a legal",0.3813953488372093,0.0938967136150235,0.018957345971563982,0.20465116279069767,0.20465116279069767
200,"summarize: In this second lecture on Don Quixoteâs relation to literature, Professor Amy Hungerford discusses the difference between romance and factoids. She starts referring to the context of the development of the modern Western canon, which is basically a collection of books on a variety of levels. The reasons include: the human passion for epics, the political and religious consequences of the Revolution, the social fears of poverty, and the universal moral dilemmas raised by the uncertainty of the new literary canon. With respect to the latter concern, GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a analyzes the history of chivalry in the post-Quixote world. He argues that Don Quiquote","summarize: Why does the Â have such common currency today? GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a believes that theÂ Â is about the effect that literature has on its readers and about the creation of literature. Its story does not belong to any previous tradition but it is a new story, and this act of invention by a fifty-year old man, Cervantes, is in itself part of modern literature.

201,"summarize: GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a starts out by commenting on the episode of the merchants of Toledo and the entrance to the inn, which may well be seen as a representation of the whole first part of theÂ. Then he moves on to discuss Don Quixoteâs status as a social being. He is distinguished both by his ability to control his madness and his diffuse anger against authority. The episodes also show the subconscious of Don Quico, who is a kind of human being, breaking with the laws of nature, and with his prior practice of harming himself rather than anyone else. In the second part, we see the rise of the idea of contingency, which is the","summarize: Important meditations about the nature of literature and the real take place in the chapters commented on in this lecture. Reality appears strange enough even to Don Quixote in the episode of the corpse, where death becomes a presence. Don Quixote appears aware that his adventures are being written as we read them. His relationship with his squire is further developed in the episode of the fulling hammers. Mambrinoâs helmet exemplifies the modern radical doubt about the power of the senses to grasp reality, while the episode of the galley slaves represents a satire of autobiographical writing.

He then moves on to introduce Don Quixote, who is a social âpious eyeballâ½� in relation to his relation to family and social status. He does so as the sons of Sancho, but Don Quiquoteâ also appears to be a kind of proto-Cervantes, having reconfigured the bonds of community rather than individual satisfaction.

This is a new model of conflictive being, capable of seeing simultaneously in two ways. The character among the galley slaves that he calls âthe prisoner of sexâ follows.
