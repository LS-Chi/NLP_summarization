0,"summarize: Professor Holloway devotes the beginning of the lecture to examining the economic crisis of the early part of the twentieth century. He examines the so-called New Deal, and notes that in this era, black leaders rose up, worked hard, and tested the resolve of the nationâs economic crisis. Yet, deeper problems revolved around the African American community, demonstrating that they were prepared to face the new tactical change in their lives, if they could identify the best course of action. At the same time, these developments also resulted in a slow and ineffective regulation of the industry, and a deep-rooted fear of civil rights movement. In his final year of his life, thousands of African Americans","summarize: The 1930s was a decade filled with economic, legal, political, and social controversy. In this lecture, Professor Holloway looks at the Great Depression and the federal governmentâs responses to it, including the New Dealâs impact on African Americans, both materially and symbolically. As the federal government openly courted their favor, African Americans organized various political groups to monitor federal activities. In the second portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway examines the achievements of the Black Cabinet, the injustices of the Scottsboro Boysâ case, and the efficacy of the âDonât Buy Where You Canâ",0.3963133640552995,0.12093023255813953,0.009389671361502348,0.20276497695852536,0.20276497695852536
1,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on Martin Luther Kingâs life and the events that led him to write his letter to the American people in March 1968. He begins referring to the poem, â½ a caging society, and then moves on to address the problem of respectability in the African American community. In the remainder of the lecture, he focuses on the struggle for power amongst African American women, demonstrating that they were prepared to fight back if King was not given full citizenship rights. In fact, thousands of African American Americans joined together to demand a new form of government, called the Black Panther Party. The movement culminated in the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery,","summarize: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement have become embodied in each other. But in this lecture, Professor Holloway asks: what of the other activists in the struggle? What of the other organizations involved in the struggle? And what of the history of the struggle before King reluctantly emerged on the scene? By uncovering the histories of the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, the death of Emmett Till, the Greensboro student sit-ins, and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one finds differing responses to violence and multiple approaches to attacking racial bias and discrimination. Professor Holloway also draws attention to the gender dynamics",0.32365145228215775,0.10878661087866108,0.03375527426160337,0.19917012448132781,0.19917012448132781
2,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on the key figures of early modern political history, with an emphasis on the analysis of the individualâs personal and political histories. He begins referring to the context of this important political history; in particular, he discusses the rise of the KKK, the anti-lynching campaign, and the â± movement. The figure of Jesse Jackson, a Virginia slave whose concerted action suggests a shift from the radicalism of the early sixties to the more exploitative mode of production, emphasizing an embrace of traditional forms of activism and a closer reading of the collective imagination.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a political biography of Jesse Jackson as a way to help understand the shifting cultural politics of the 1960s, the rise of a different array of politics in the 1970s, and the high politics of the 1980s. Professor Holloway traces Jacksonâs ascension into Martin Luther Kingâs inner-circle, his work in Chicago with Operation Breadbasket and then later with Operation PUSH, his reaction to Kingâs assassination, his national economic boycotts, and his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns.

3,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses race in the context of the civil rights movement. He begins referring to the âwar on raceâ¯� movement, the event at Gettysburg, a gathering about black sexuality in general, and then moves on to address the fundamental shift in the tone and tactics of the movement. In the remainder of the lecture, Prof. Holloway focuses on Carl Stokesâs 1967 mayoral victory in Cleveland, the formation of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969, and the 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana. The delegates that contested the election are assembled, and their ideas about race are revisited.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the connections between media and high politics during the late 1980s and 1990s and reveals the ways that race was replaced by a series of keywordsâsuch as crime, drugs, and welfareâthat acted as racial signifiers in our national discourse. An examination of the political rhetoric from the George H.W.

4,"summarize: In this lecture, Professor Blight discusses the rise of the KKK, an organization that seeks to destroy the African American community by pushing African Americans out of the U.S. South. The leaders of this group prioritize their lives in the country, uplift and respectability, and race management. On the one hand, these leaders prioritize the rights of African Americans, and on the other hand, they prioritize the exclusion of whites from the society. After suggesting some of the ways in which African Americans have been affected by the recent war with Mexico, Blight focuses on the role of whites in society. The lecture ends with a discussion of a number of African American cultural and political groups, such as the â","summarize: In the closing decades of the 1800s, African Americans witnessed the end of Reconstruction, the Redemption of the white South, and increased threats to their political, economic, physical, and psychological well-being. Historians often refer to this era as the ânadir,â the lowest point, in the post-Emancipation black experience. But, as Professor Holloway explains in this lecture, the oppressive realities of black life did not silence the most dedicated black activists. During this time, a new generation of black political and intellectual leaders, including Alexander Crummell, Anna Julia Cooper, and W. E. B. Du Bois, dedicated themselves to",0.34234234234234234,0.07272727272727272,0.009174311926605505,0.2072072072072072,0.2072072072072072
5,"summarize: In this lecture Booker T. Washington, a black leader in the early nineteenth century, offers a brief summary of the political and social context of the early twentieth century. Professor Blight begins with an analysis of some of the ways in which race influenced the post-emancipation African American movement, suggesting that black leaders, together with whites, intended to build a great steam line so blacks could partake in nation-building. After a discussion of the radical, anti-lynching campaign of 1866, Blight focuses on the role of white supremacist violence in brining about the end of Reconstruction. The lecture concludes with an exploration of the complicated nature of race and the Supreme Courtâs decision to recognize","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Holloway explains the two major schools of thought that emerged at the end of the century to solve the problems of black social and economic distress. The accommodationists, like Booker T. Washington, believed that the quickest way to improve the quality of black life was to forge a social peace with powerful whites, temporarily accepting the continued separation of the races and advocating vocational education as a pragmatic way for blacks to improve their lives. Opposed to Washington were people like Anna Julia Cooper and W.E.B. Du Bois who embraced assimilation and saw higher education as the cure-all to racialized problems.

6,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock discusses the Fitzgerald stories of. She begins with an introduction of F. Scott Fitzgeraldâs, a class assignment on the rise of the modern novel. Invoking the theories of Bernard Williams and Henry Goddard, she argues that Fitzgerald uses his sources of wealth to strip the moral weight of the material substance of life and to render it meaningless. This theme is explored in the elegies, by way of John Guillory, Robert Penn Warren, and Toni Morrison.Â","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock demonstrates how four of Fitzgeraldâs most famous short storiesââThe Rich Boy,â âBabylon Revisited,â âThe Diamond as Big as the Ritz,â and âBernice Bobs Her Hairâârepresent âsocial types,â generic identities that Fitzgerald explores as forms of social reality.

7,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of with a discussion of Parisâs place within the modern United States. She presents a painted sketch of the city, setting the stage for a discussion on the rise of fascism in the American West, and arguing that its leaders were inspired by the moral imperative of working together to strip the decadence of the state and render it empty-handed. In a consideration of the consequences of this strategy, she shows how the optimism of the collective has been frozen in time and reduced to a few moments of reflection.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of by analyzing the contrast Robert Jordan draws between âdistant homesâ and the on-site environment of the Spanish Civil War. She juxtaposes his invocations of Paris and Missouri to the rooted communities of the guerillas, and reads analogies of racial and ethnic conflictâspecifically, the references to the Moors in Spain and persecuted blacks in Americaâas a point of tension, an ironic commentary on the coexistence of the distant home and the on-site environment.

8,"summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses on the section âThe Great Migrationâ±,â XXVII-XXVI. She begins with a discussion of Pilar and the ways in which they have been marked by a move from the Eurocentricism of the 1960s to an attenuation of the lived experience of ordinary people. Moving away from tragedy to comedy, Professor Dimock traces the development of the modernist mode of writing known as the mirror stage. Crucial terms such as ambivalence and sly civility are used to underscore the contrast between popular emotional appeal and detached artistic judgment.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by reading the novel as a narrative of dispossession and repossession. She argues that the rape of Maria, which takes place in front of a barbershop mirror, enacts one type of disempowerment; the end of Robert Jordanâs life represents another, but with the potential for redemption. She shows how Jordan vacillates between a âhaveâ and a âhave not,â depending on how ironically one understands Mariaâs question âWhat hast thou?â",0.34682080924855496,0.058479532163742694,0.03550295857988166,0.21965317919075147,0.21965317919075147

She begins with a discussion of the ways in which Hemerway positions his novel vis-Ã -vis the Cuban Revolutions and moves on to Cuba. The focus remains on the aesthetics of the city, with Hemingwellâve been shown to move from one historiographic mode to another, but he has been liberated from this radical vision of something called the Enlightenment. In the decades immediately following the Cuban Revolution, he revisits elements of the Enlightenment that were previously ignored, including the understanding of history in terms of sensory experience, the emergence of new literary forms,","summarize: Professor Dimock introduces the class to the works of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner, the premiere writers of American modernism. She orients their novels along three âscalesâ of interpretation: global geopolitics, experimental narration, and sensory detail. Invoking the writings of critic Paul Fussell, she argues that all three writers are united by a preoccupation with World War I and the implications that the Great War has for irony in narrative representation.",0.27027027027027023,0.01092896174863388,0.0,0.17297297297297298,0.17297297297297298
10,"summarize: Professor Blight uses Hightowerâs notion of race as a test case for the thesis that we can better understand ourselves by examining our attitudes about race. After laying out the roots of the modern United States, Blight discusses some of the key concepts that will be explored over the course of the semester, including notions of freedom, equality, and fraternity. The lecture concludes with a discussion of James Alexanderâan example of a mixed-race societyâand then moves to race.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses on the unresolved problem of race in, focusing her discussion on the variety of reflexive and calculated uses of the word âniggerâ as a charged term toward Joe Christmas. She shows how the semantic burden of the word varies â used under duress by Joe Brown and the dietician, deliberately made light of by Hightower and Bobbie, fused with the contrary meanings of Calvinist theology by Joanna Burden, and finally ironized by Joe Christmas himself.

11,"summarize: Professor Amy Hungerford situates Faulknerâs in a tradition of black novel on the syllabus, following the lead of Luster and Dilsey, and showing how their convergences and divergences tell the entire store of the novel. The narrative of Benjy, as an omniscient narrator, suggests that the playing field has been radically reconfigured, and that the characters who are introduced have a new set of abilities and will continue to learn more about the past than is traditionally taught. This theme is explored by examining the characters themselves, particularly Luster, who continually lure us to see the future beyond what we can see in the present.","summarize: Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of by juxtaposing Quentinâs stream-of-consciousness to his brother Benjyâs narrative subjectivity. Professor Dimock argues that Faulkner uses stylistic parallels between the two sections to communicate âkinshipâ and âvariationâ between the two narrators. In her readings, she focuses on their relationship with the black characters in, as well as their reactions to Caddyâs loss of sexual innocence.

The examples given in the previous lecture are discussed and explained. The problems addressed are introduced and students learn how to construct a three-dimensional universe using relativity.,"summarize: One last key concept in Special Relativity is introduced before discussion turns again to black celestial bodies (black holes in particular) that manifest the relativistic effects students have learned about in the previous lectures. The new concept deals with describing events in a coordinate system of space and time. A mathematical explanation is given for how space and time reverse inside the Schwarzschild radius through sign changes in the metric. Evidence for General Relativity is offered from astronomical objects. The predicted presence and subsequent discovery of Neptune as proof of General Relativity are discussed, and stellar mass black holes are introduced.Step by Step into a Black HoleCourtesy of Ute Kraus, Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Gravitations",0.3614457831325301,0.0975609756097561,0.04938271604938271,0.18072289156626506,0.18072289156626506
13,"summarize: The expansion of the universe is discussed as an alternative to the Big Bang theory presented in the previous lecture. The point at which we can consider the emergence of a new, more electronic universe is examined. The Big Bang explained how mass and energy are affected by the gravitational force exerted on the universe by its gravitational lensing. Finally, we discuss the possibility of traveling far beyond the boundaries of time and space.","summarize: Professor Bailyn returns to the subject of the expansion of the universe to offer explanations that do not require belief in the Big Bang theory. One alternative is a theory that, in the past, the entire universe was reduced to an âinitial singularity,â in which everything was much closer, and therefore denser and hotter. Since the universe is in constant flux, however, it follows that in the future things will drift apart. The Steady State explanation for the expansion of the universe is then explained. Coined as a derogatory term meant to ridicule supporters of the Big Bang theory, Steady State purports that new energy and matter are constantly created as the universe expands",0.4210526315789474,0.14893617021276595,0.07526881720430108,0.27368421052631575,0.27368421052631575
14,"summarize: Class begins with a discussion of distance modulus in galaxies. Topics will include the extent to which we are sure the universe is destroyed, how massive it is, and how we can observe it. The point at which we consider the existence of a star in a dark hole is examined. The rest of the lecture introduces a new concept related to cosmology: the discovery of 51 Peg b (Fall 2008) and the âNewtonian Planet Theory (2008). The lecture then turns to strong-field relativity: relativistic effects that help us identify objects in the Universe, such as galaxies and black holes.","summarize: Class begins with a review of the mysterious nature of dark matter, which accounts for three quarters of the universe. Different models of the universe are graphed. The nature, frequency, and duration of supernovae are then addressed. Professor Bailyn presents data from the Supernova Cosmology Project and pictures of supernovae taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery of dark energy is revisited and the density of dark energy is calculated. The Big Rip is presented as an alternative hypothesis for the fate of the universe.",0.35978835978835977,0.106951871657754,0.04324324324324324,0.253968253968254,0.253968253968254
15,"summarize: Class begins with a review of the main sources for cosmology, such as mass, dark energy density and more recently discovered galaxies. The question is raised, however, whether the accelerating of the universe is accelerating, or if we are right about what we believe. The fact that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating means that the rate of expansion cannot be slowed by changes in the density of matter, which is the key to accelerating. The second half of the lecture introduces a new concept related to cosmology: dark matter. The discovery of 51 Peg b (Fall 2008) revealed a chain mechanism for the growth of galaxies.","summarize: Reasons for the expansion of the universe are addressed at the start of this lecture, focusing especially on the acceleration of dark energy. Supernovae were the first evidence for the existence of dark energy. Two other proofs are presented. The first is the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is perfectly smooth and equal in all directions. It firmly supports the Big Bang theory. Projects attempting to measure it, such as COBE and WMAP, are discussed. Secondly, Large-Scale Clustering is introduced: by measuring the degree of clustering, astronomers hope to advance their understanding of dark energy and dark matter. Computer simulations of the evolution of the universe are shown.",0.42666666666666675,0.1345291479820628,0.04524886877828054,0.2311111111111111,0.2311111111111111
16,"summarize: Class begins with a review of the Kepler mission, launched in 2009, which aims to determine the extent to which we are sure the existence of the planet is imminent. Through a variety of examples, we show how complexity occurs on a cosmological scale, and how it is measured by the amount of light that is being lost. The concept of planetary migration is discussed in greater detail and given special emphasis on the dramatic differences between the celestial bodies in the Inner and Outer Solar System. Finally, we consider a number of problems related to the brightness of the star system, such as the pressure difference between the Coriolis force and the pressure change at the boundaries of galaxies.","summarize: Class begins with a problem on transits and learning what information astronomers obtain through observing them. For example, radii of stars can be estimated. Furthermore, applying the Doppler shift method, one can find the mass of a star. Finally, a starâs density can be calculated. A second method for identifying planets around stars is introduced: the astrometry method. The method allows for an extremely accurate assessment of a starâs precise position in the sky. Special features of the astrometry method are discussed and a number of problems are solved. A short summary is given on the three methods astronomers use to identify exoplanets.

Professor stresses the importance of studying the blood flow through glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and structural aspect of the heart, and the different chambers in the heart. Important terms and concepts such as systole/diastole pressures and cardiac output (HR) are discussed. Next, a number of important issues related to cardiac physiology are addressed and students learn how to detect them by translating sound wave reflections into structural images at fast timescale.","summarize: Professor Saltzman discusses the biophysics of the circulatory system. He begins by describing the anatomy of different types of blood vessels, and states the relationship between pressure difference (ÎP) as the driving force for fluid flow (Q) in a tube (i.e., blood vessel) with some resistance R (ÎP = RQ). R can be calculated using if dimensions of the tube () and fluid viscosity () are known:Â.

He presents the different modes of motion among different organisms, taking first the example flight to talk about viscoelasticity and the relationship between size and shape. Next, modeling the body as a spherical structure, moving at speeds comparable to a planetâs speed or velocity, in terms of viscoels and articulations. The concepts of flight and walking are discussed as related to the design and function of many objects, such as roller coasters and a planet orbiting the Sun. Finally, challenges and areas for improvement in posture and velocity are presented.","summarize: Professor Saltzman introduces the material properties of elasticity and viscosity. He describes two separate experimental setups to measure the elasticity and the viscosity of a material. Material elasticity can be defined in terms of stress-strain property, and defines the Youngâs modulus (E), which is the slope of the stress-strain curve. Fluid viscosity, on the other hand, is described by shear stress. When modeling any material, the spring can be used to represent an ideal elastic material and the dashpot an ideal viscoelastic material.

Magnetic resonance imaging (GFR) allows reconstructing a three-dimensional image of DNA, which can be seen in many lengths. The structure of DNA is discussed in detail, as well as its derivation from the germ theory of DNA. Next, modeling the genome based on the moleculeâs structural similarity to those in DNA, modeling it into a larger mirror. Finally, modeling DNA as a molecular clock to measure its mass is discussed.","summarize: Professor Saltzman introduces the elements of molecular structure of DNA such as backbone, base composition, base pairing, and directionality of nucleic acids. He describes the processes of DNA synthesis, transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational processing required to make a protein such as insulin from its genetic code (DNA). Professor Saltzman describes the genetic code.

The different tissues in the body can be divided into chromosomes, or groups of cells, which code for proteins. This process helps to map the genotype of a cell into the phenotype expressed by the organism. Next, modeling the body as a host/foreign organism, this process proceeds along cytotoxic lines involving immune cells, the cell membrane, and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that affect growth and differentiation of DNA. Finally, modeling stem cell development as an organism with five-membered stents reveals important differences in cell size and function in relation to mammalian cells.","summarize: Professor Saltzman describes the processes of fertilization and embryogenesis. Professor Saltzman then talks about the definition and classification of different types of stem cells, where stem cells are found in the body, and the potential for use of stem cells in treating diseases.

The role of the digestive and pulmonary system in maintaining an organismâs internal environment is discussed. The cell communication and immunology within the body, which can be affected by drug and gene therapy, are discussed. Finally, modeling the body as a biological vessel with five different tissues: the systemic and efferent hemispheres, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the extracellular matrix are described.","summarize: Professor Saltzman talks about cell communication, specifically ligand-receptor interactions that are important in maintaining homeostasis in the body. Different types of receptors and ligands, the nature of their interactions and ways to apply this into developing drugs are discussed (eg. Aldopa, Taximofen, beta-blockers).

The electron density is a function of the square of the wavefunction, which can be reduced to a few atoms. The SchrÃ¶dinger Equation is used to show that there are many more electrons in a nucleus than in a city, and that Newtonâs laws are consistent with relativity.","summarize: In discussions of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation thus far, the systems described were either one-dimensional or involved a single electron. After discussing how increased nuclear charge affects the energies of one-electron atoms and then discussing hybridization, this lecture finally addresses the simple fact that multi-electron systems cannot be properly described in terms of one-electron orbitals.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)",0.34965034965034963,0.07092198581560284,0.02877697841726619,0.1958041958041958,0.1958041958041958
25,"summarize: We discuss the idea of hyperconjugation by focusing on the overlap of two orbitals at a single point. This can be visualized using the same electron difference density trick we used to measure the difference density between atoms, and embedding it into the wave function that unifies molecules. The hydrogen molecule is used to illustrate the utility of molecular orbital theory as a predictor of chemical reactivity.",summarize: Professor McBride uses this lecture to show that covalent bonding depends primarily on two factors: orbital overlap and energy-match. First he discusses how overlap depends on hybridization; then how bond strength depends on the number of shared electrons. In this way quantum mechanics shows that Coulombâs law answers Newtonâs query about what âmakes the Particles of Bodies stick together by very strong Attractions.â Energy mismatch between the constituent orbitals is shown to weaken the influence of their overlap. The predictions of this theory are confirmed experimentally by measuring the bond strengths of H-H and H-F during heterolysis,0.3391812865497076,0.023668639053254437,0.0,0.17543859649122806,0.17543859649122806
26,"summarize: In this lecture we return to discussing the constitution and configuration of hybrid orbitals. The traditional view stated that a pure atom has a two-dimensional orbital, but this requires merging the results from the experiment with the modern theory. We discuss how this might vary across molecular orbitals and may occur in acidic media. The alternative method involves moving a vacant orbital away from a stable orbital to a more stable orbital. The approach is illustrated by a simple example of a âplum-puddingâ²â atom pair. The low-order rate constants in a carbon with a high-order C=O double orbital determine its orbital shape. The curious relative rates in step","summarize: This lecture brings experiment to bear on the previous theoretical discussion of bonding by focusing on hybridization of the central atom in three XHÂ molecules. Because independent electron pairs must not overlap, hybridization can be related to molecular structure by a simple equation. The âUmbrella Vibrationâ and the associated rehybridization of the central atom is used to illustrate how a competition between strong bonds and stable atoms works to create differences in molecular structure that discriminate between bonding models.

He introduces students to Fischerâs notion of perspectival perception, and explains how it is used to measure the tilt of objects in space, such as galaxies and planets. The Jupiter Study, which uses stereochemistry to investigate the behavior of light in molecules by analyzing electron difference density through a number of instruments, can help constrain theories about the existence of chiral chain halogenation and â²-reduced crystallography.Professor McBride begins with a summary of the basic ideas underlying organic chemistry: changelessness, hybridity, and polarizability.","summarize: Determination of the actual atomic arrangement in tartaric acid in 1949 motivated a change in stereochemical nomenclature from Fischerâs 1891 genealogical convention (D, L) to the CIP scheme (R, S) based on conventional group priorities.

The Boltzmann factor favors minimal energy in order to provide the largest number of different arrangements of âbitsâ of energy. The slippery concept of disorder is illustrated using Couette flow.

Professor McBride begins with a review of moleculesâs location and energy-matching scheme, their rotation axis, and their stereochemistry. This led to discussion of molecular structure and dynamics using the spectroscopic tools of the ancient Greeks and early twentieth-century chemists.

32,"summarize: Wurtz and Liebig began discussing the possibility of homologating anhydrides by modifying the Friedel-Crafts reaction to obtain the desired product. This inspired a general theory of organic chemistry focusing on so-called radicals, collections of atoms that appeared to behave as elements and persist unchanged through organic reactions. Liebig developed a strictly logical system for proving the existence of cyclopropanes in the 19th century, but he was unable to advance due to the opposition between the competing classes. A consequence of their radical-revolutionary approach was the imposition of antiseptics on the carbonyl group of sugars.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall","summarize: The Friedel-Crafts reaction creates new alkyl- or acyl-aromatic bonds, with or without cation rearrangement. Designing reaction sequences, especially those involving diazonium intermediates, so as to access a wide variety of substituted benzenes provides a good introduction to the challenges of synthetic organic chemistry. Aromatic rings with strong electron withdrawal can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which plays an important role in biochemistry.

34,"summarize: Reaction order can be understood in terms of reaction order and rate. A linear, triatomic system is formed when a dominant species enters equilibrium with a reactive species.Â This mechanism can be driven by the ability of alkenes to increase the concentration of a moleculeâs atoms or by a change in its orbital shape.Â Reactions can occur in step-dependent ways using a number of methods, such as ascending-down mass action, hybridization, and polarizability.Â Classic experiments by Kenyon and Phillips established the nature of Walden-Crafts alkyl halides and their derivatives.Professor McBrideâ","summarize: Curious kinetic orders can be mechanistically informative. Fractional kinetic orders suggest dissociation of a dominant aggregate to give a smaller reactive species. An apparent negative kinetic order, due to competition with a second-order process, leads to spontaneous deracemization of chiral crystals. Changes in bond dissociation energies can be due to differences in bonds or in radicals. Although it is often said that the order of alkyl radical stability is tertiary > secondary > primary, careful analysis suggests that the order of bond dissociation energies may be due to differences in the alkanes rather than in the radicals.

Substituent influence on the rate of rapid shift demonstrates four effects: autoxidation of anhydrides to carboxyl groups, substitution of H using sigma*, and oxidation of C with C. The acidity of carbonyl compounds can be understood in terms of hyperconjugation or polarizability. Using molecular orbital theory we can estimate the rate at which anion shifts from stable to unstable states. Averaging of the radical to depolarized chain shifts free radicals from stable states.

When the starting material is a hydrogen atom, the rate of forming a new hydrogen atom can be predicted by means of resonance theory. Although the hydrogen atom is a carbon atom, it can be driven to produce a more radical than a carbonyl group.Â It can be used to drive such rapid reactions toward completion or to generate a more stable carbonyle atom.Â This mechanism is commonly used to illustrate the utility of localized bonds in organic transformations.Â Experimental determination of bond strengths suggests a chain mechanism for free-radical chain reactions.Professor McBrideâ",summarize: The reactivity-selectivity principle explains why bromine atoms are more selective that chlorine atoms in abstracting hydrogen atoms from carbon. A free-radical mechanism for adding HBr to alkenes explains its anti-Markovnikov regiospecificity. Careful analysis is required to understand kinetic order for reactions involving catalysts. Termination of radical-chain reactions can make their rate half-order in the initiator.

He argues that Athens, like otherÂ, undergoes political and social turmoil due to the rise of the idea of self-government. He also points out that in response to these developments, there is a great need for reform and changes in Greek society. However, this change cannot be achieved under the leadership of traditional forms of government, which emphasized reading and interpretation of literature. The need for a government that respects human knowledge and autonomy, in addition to the general will, must be considered with an eye for survivorship and back-fill biases.","summarize: Professor Donald Kagan explains why people should study the ancient Greeks. He argues that the Greeks are worthy of our study not only because of their vast achievements and contributions to Western civilization (such as in the fields of science, law, and politics) but also because they offer a unique perspective on humanity. To the Greeks, man was both simultaneously capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes; he was both great and important, but also mortal and fallible. He was a tragic figure, powerful but limited. Therefore, by studying the Greeks, one gains insight into a tension that has gripped and shaped the West and the rest of the world through its influence.

He argues that Cleombrotusâ strategy was characterized by unifying Athens and pushing Sparta to a more democratic government. However, this strategy was seriously challenged when the Athenians under the leadership of Demosthenes emerged unable to control Sparta due to the emergence of an increasingly acrimonious tone of the aristocracy.

This has occurred in the form of processes such as temperature and salinity in the ocean, and in the case of primates, which can inhabit the surface of the Earthâs atmosphere. Temperature varies in a more gradual way with altitude in the oceans, with several changes in the climate (i.e., Pinatubo in 1991). The overall heat transfer rate of a planet is about half that of a city or smaller than it would prefer to be.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at:Â","summarize: Every species on earth has an environmental range in which it can live.

We discuss Player and Playerâ±, and explore the implications of the game by looking at the strengths and weaknesses of both players. A critique of the classic model is presented, and we discuss some implications for the theory of investment banking in society. Toward the end of the class, we introduce a new idea to address the Social Security problem. We ask what kinds of problems are solved and how they might improve the society and economies of society. We construct a model of financial crisis by starting from a solution to a crisis, and building on that model to show that there are two flaws.","summarize: We consider games in which players move sequentially rather than simultaneously, starting with a game involving a borrower and a lender. We analyze the game using âbackward induction.â The game features moral hazard: the borrower will not repay a large loan. We discuss possible remedies for this kind of problem. One remedy involves incentive design: writing contracts that give the borrower an incentive to repay. Another involves commitment strategies; in this case providing collateral. We consider other commitment strategies such as burning boats.

This model helps us understand the Nash Equilibrium and also how firms can make rational choices about what quantities they should choose for their output (and how much they should be able to produce). The main part of the lecture focuses on the powerful tool of backward induction, which is introduced in the previous lecture. We construct a model of financial equilibrium based on two firmsâ convergences and two models of imperfect competition. Customers are shown to choose whether or not to take a firm on an equal number of bases.","summarize: We first apply our big ideaâbackward inductionâto analyze quantity competition between firms when play is sequential, the Stackelberg model. We do this twice: first using intuition and then using calculus. We learn that this game has a first-mover advantage, and that it comes commitment and from information in the game rather than the timing per se. We notice that in some games having more information can hurt you if other players know you will have that information and hence alter their behavior.

We ask what these Nash equilibria are and how we construct them from the ideas presented in the previous lecture. A mathematical example is a game in which a player cannot distinguish between good and evil, and indifferent. We represent this first by rolling back each of the nodes from the beginning to the present.","summarize: We first discuss Zermeloâs theorem: that games like tic-tac-toe or chess have a solution. That is, either there is a way for player 1 to force a win, or there is a way for player 1 to force a tie, or there is a way for player 2 to force a win. The proof is by induction. Then we formally define and informally discuss both perfect information and strategies in such games. This allows us to find Nash equilibria in sequential games. But we find that some Nash equilibria are inconsistent with backward induction.

We represent the interests of the various players in the class, and therefore also their beliefs about what the other market is going to do.

We discuss how to build the idea of reputation into game theory; in particular, in setting like this where a threat or promise would otherwise not be credible. The key idea is that players may not be completely certain about other playersâ payoffs or even their rationality. In the second half of the lecture, we stage a duel, a game of pre-emption. The key strategic question in such games is when; in this case, when to fire. We use two ideas from earlier lectures, dominance and backward induction, to analyze the game.

Then he turns to a discussion of two firms in which firms are likely to disclose their costs. The firms that are on either end of a long road or line, and adjust their costs depending on the economy and financial conditions. The two firms differ in their costs but the outlook of Firm A is typically pessimistic. Customers live along this line. The outlook of both firms on the economic and financial markets is also pessimistic. According to this outlook, it is likely that the firms will be less profitable than if they had chosen a different model.

We should always interpret attempts to communicate or signal such information taking into account the incentives of the person doing the signaling. In the first setting, information is verifiable. Here, the failure explicitly to reveal information can be informative, and hence verifiable information tends to come out even when you donât want it to. We consider examples of such information unraveling. Then we move to unverifiable information. Here, it is hard to convey such information even if you want to.

We first distinguish two extremes: common values and private values. We hold a common value auction in class and discover the winnerâs curse, the winner tends to overpay. We discuss why this occurs and how to avoid it: you should bid as if you knew that your bid would win; that is, as if you knew your initial estimate of the common value was the highest. This leads you to bid much below your initial estimate. Then we discuss four forms of auction: first-price sealed-bid, second-price sealed-bid, open ascending, and open descending auctions. We discuss bidding strategies in each auction form for the case when values are private. Finally,",0.325,0.04201680672268908,0.0,0.15833333333333335,0.15833333333333335

Popularized by Lost Cause apologists and biased lenders, prepaying your remaining balance can help prevent large amounts of loans, but must be taken at face value. Using backward induction, we calculate the borrowerâs optimal strategy and to evaluate the odds of prepaying the remaining balance.

The option to prepay, the refinancing option, makes the mortgage much more complicated than a coupon bond, and therefore something that a hedge fund could make money trading. In this lecture we discuss how to build and calibrate a model to forecast prepayments in order to value mortgages. Old fashioned economists still make non-contingent forecasts, like the recent predictions that unemployment would peak at 8%. A model makes contingent forecasts.

Subsequently, he looks at the history of the mortgage market from the perspective of a mathematician, a young man, in an attempt to understand the role of investment banking in society. Significant attention is paid to the mechanics and role of the stock market, as well as its role in society, financial markets, regulation, commercial banking, securities trading, and institutions.

The basic model of hedge strategies presented in this lecture is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which can be derived from contracts between traders and arbitrageurs. Taking account of the implications of the random walk theory, it becomes possible to hedge against irrational deviations from traditional fair-value models. The main part of the lecture focuses on the extraordinary returns that hedge hedge strategies can take place. The second half of the class is on derivatives. The third large margin hedge strategies we develop are called arbitrageously hedging against contingencies. We show how diversification can reduce risk exposure for a hedge fund like ours.","summarize: This lecture reviews the intuition from the previous class, where the idea of dynamic hedging was introduced. We learn why the crucial idea of dynamic hedging is marking to market: even when there are millions of possible scenarios that could come to pass over time, by hedging a little bit each step of the way, the number of possibilities becomes much more manageable.

It represents individualsâ ownership in publicly-held corporations. Although corporations have a variety of stakeholders, the shareholders of a for-profit corporation are central since the company is ultimately responsible to them.

63,"summarize: Regulation of financial and securities markets is one of the most recent ways in which regulators move from an internal regulation to a regulator. The role played by individuals within a regulatory framework, called a board of directors, allows the government to impose stricter regulations on big and important companies than on smaller, less well-known companies. The macroprudential regulation protects the public while also enabling them to make personal investment decisions. However, regulation can be a thorny issue for many people and regulators. In many cases, regulation is ineffective and often left without a good outcome.","summarize: After talking about human failures and foibles in the last lecture, in this lecture Professor Shiller discusses regulation to minimize the impact of human errors.

The fact that, in the context of a nineteenth-century novel, Robinson Crusoe novels are a modern novel that illuminates the important individual and collective events of this novel, and indeed questions of origins and originality itself. The Christian hell of Robinson Cruso, for example, structures its narrative around a mythology of the unwed mother, but also displaces a traditional form of narrative from the previous novel: a story about a writer, a community whose loss is mourned in the visionary poems of Toni Morrison.","summarize: In this lecture on, Professor Hungerford traces the ways that Rothâs novel conforms to and pushes beyond the genre she calls the Identity Plot. Exploring the various ways that race can be construed as category, mark, biology, or performance, the novel ultimately construes the defining characteristic of its protagonistâs race to be its very concealment. Secrecy is, for Roth, the source of identity and the driving force behind desire and narrative.",0.3191489361702128,0.05376344086021505,0.021739130434782608,0.22340425531914893,0.22340425531914893

She uses excerpts from pamphlets and other unusual prose sources to introduce the novel, including an in-depth analysis of the poem â±, which is completely innocent of its surroundings. The novelty of Rothian language and its imbalances is tied with the broader context of the piece, giving human dimensions of what is heard and what is seen.

She shows how Foer borrows and adapts themes and styles from other authors on the syllabus in service to his ambition as a writer to demonstrate the power of narrative fiction to address the great historical traumas of our time. In thus attempting to marry the nineteenth-century social novel with Postmodernist, or late Modernist, techniques, Foer participates in an emerging tradition that risks the confusion between resonant emotion and sentimental clichÃ©",0.3842364532019705,0.06965174129353234,0.020100502512562818,0.20689655172413793,0.20689655172413793

She begins by discussing Humbertâ±, a dialogue taking place in the novel about race, sexuality, and the process whereby we shift from one perspective to another: the story about the writing of the novel, and whether we can escape from it by accepting it. Just as we can no longer appreciate the beauty of a beautiful and poisonous messiah, we must also recognize the fragility of our modern society.","summarize: Professor Amy Hungerford introduces the first of three lectures on NabokovâsÂ by surveying studentsâ reactions to the novel, highlighting the conflicting emotions readers feel, enjoying Nabokovâs virtuosic style, but being repelled by the violence of his subject matter. Nabokovâs childhood in tsarist Russia provides some foundation for his interest in memory, imagination, and language.

She begins by exploring the boundaries of literary modernism, including the idea that we can better understand our consciousness through the process of writing about ourselves, other characters, and perhaps even our perception of ourselves. She then moves to a discussion of the fine-spirited nature of literature and its concern for the artistic community. The result, she argues, is that we must subject ourselves to certain forms of scrutiny, making us wary of what may come when we take too far.","summarize: In this guest lecture, Teaching Fellow Andrew Goldstone provides us with some key concepts for understanding Modernism and Nabokovâs relation in particular to his literary forebears T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. Positing the âknightâs moveâ as a description of Nabokovâs characteristically indirect, evasive style, Goldstone argues that Nabokovâs parodies of Modernist form in fact reveal his deep commitment to some of the same aesthetic principles.

They form when parcels of air are heated or cooled, and act to increase the temperature of the ocean. Temperature varies in a more complicated way with altitude in the atmosphere, with several inversions which occur at the boundaries of the various layers of the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is sufficiently stable, the amount of projected warming associated with these changes will decrease exponentially.","summarize: Air is able to hold a limited amount of water vapor, and that amount depends on the temperature of the air. When this saturation vapor pressure is exceeded, liquid water begins to condense and clouds form. There are several different types of clouds, some which rain and others which do not, and each with characteristics specific to it. Vortices are a particular type of cloud phenomenon in which there is a low pressure anomaly in the center of the cloud with rotating air around it, forming funnel clouds as seen in tornados. The low pressure allows liquid water to condense and form the funnel shaped cloud.

They act as good intracellular greenhouse gas storage devices in the atmosphere, and act as a sort of molecular clock to determine the amount of solar insolation received at the Earthâs surface. The formation of a planet orbiting the equator is discussed in greater detail, with particular emphasis placed on the effects of the wind stress on the Earth system.","summarize: The circulation in the atmosphere is composed of three circulation cells in the northern and southern hemispheres. These cells are caused by the rotation of the Earth which creates the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force deflects northern hemisphere motion to the right and southern hemisphere motion to the left. The majority of large-scale motion in the atmosphere is in geostrophic balance, meaning the Coriolis force acting on the motion is balanced by a pressure gradient force. The rotation of cyclones and anticyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres is controlled by this geostrophic balance.",0.3294117647058824,0.07142857142857142,0.012048192771084336,0.24705882352941175,0.24705882352941175

Finally, satellite images of Mount Purgatory are compared with views taken at the Arctic Circle and elsewhere.",summarize: The seasonal cycle on Earth causes shifts in the bands of precipitation in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar front shifts between high and mid-latitudes which causes a latitudinal shift in the occurrence of frontal cyclones. The Intertropical Convergence Zone also shifts across the equator bringing bands of precipitation to different tropical regions throughout the year. Regional climates on Earth have been classified based on temperature and precipitation values.

Temperature and salinity in the ocean can be affected by the wind stress acting on the ocean surface. Heat can create thermohaline currents, and precipitation and evaporation change the density of the ocean. Surface winds also act as a forcing mechanism on ocean currents by creating a wind stress forcing that pushes ocean currents.","summarize: Ocean currents are generally divided into two categories: thermohaline currents and wind driven currents. Both types of currents are forced remotely rather than locally. Wind driven currents are initially forced by the wind stress causing water to pile up in certain locations. This produces a pressure gradient, which is then balanced by the Coriolis force and geostrophic currents develop. The gyre circulations found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are wind driven currents. There is a connection between the physics of these currents and the biological productivity in the ocean. For example, productivity is greatest in areas of equatorial and coastal upwelling as nutrient rich deep water is brought to the sunlit surface.",0.3783783783783784,0.08743169398907104,0.04419889502762431,0.18378378378378377,0.18378378378378377
93,"summarize: By the year 2100, world population has increased dramatically from about 2 billion to 3 billion. This increase is unprecedented and we cannot predict its long-term effects. Continentality also affects the geological makeup of ecosystems and can affect human well-being. The human brain evolved for this ancient climate, and humans were forced to make choices based on their ability to limit their fertility. Springtime temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are typically much lower than that in other parts of the world. They can also be added to or removed from the climate.","summarize: Ice on earth is sensitive to climate change and ice plays a role in climate change processes. Recent trends in the Greenland ice sheet provide an important example. Over the past two decades the extent of surface melt water on the ice sheet has increased. In addition, satellites have detected a decrease in the overall mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Paleoclimate is also discussed in this lecture, with a focus on climate over the last 5 million years. The mid-Pliocene was a particularly warm period from 3.3-3 million years before present. The Pleistocene was a more recent cold period ending with the Last Glacial Maximum about 14,000 years before present.

94,"summarize: Geology and climate have shaped the development of modern scientific theories. One analysis suggests that the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere is a direct product of the recent discovery of tritium, a commonly used herbicide. Another shows that life forms tend to begin small and evolve to be bigger over time. Life sciences rely on the availability of radio waves and imitators, which are designed to help deliver a message to the population.","summarize: Isotopes are used to measure past climate properties. Deuterium and oxygen 18 are the most commonly used climate proxies. Lighter isotopes evaporate more readily from the ocean, so water vapor in the atmosphere is isotopically lighter than ocean water. This vapor gets lighter still as it is transported to higher latitudes while losing mass by precipitation. These processes leave an isotopic signal of temperature and continental ice volume in ice cores and deep sea sediment cores.",0.2368421052631579,0.05333333333333334,0.027027027027027025,0.14473684210526316,0.14473684210526316
95,"summarize: The IPCC has released its preliminary climate update to the IPCC report, which stresses the central role of science in climate change. It also updates the IPCCâs current climate stance and describes current efforts to reduce global warming. World War II bore witness to a great influx of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, and more recently global warming has been discussed as a potential government intervention. The IPCC reviews the climate change impacts of this warming, and also reviews the effects of global warming on human health.","summarize: The issue of global warming is discussed. Recent climate change over the last half of the 20 century is thought to be driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide playing a large role. The carbon cycle describes the reservoirs of carbon (atmosphere, terrestrial biomass and ocean) and the exchanges that occur between these reservoirs. Inputs of carbon to the atmosphere include burning of fossil fuels and respiration from biomass. Vegetation also removes carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and a similar uptake of carbon from the atmosphere occurs in the ocean through biological processes. Residence time for carbon in the atmosphere can be computed and is estimated to be a few hundred years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has been measured directly since the 1950s",0.33488372093023255,0.07511737089201878,0.00947867298578199,0.17674418604651163,0.17674418604651163
96,"summarize: Wind farms are a non-profit organization, not a government agency, and therefore must be capable of generating electricity from the ground. The lecture discusses the various factors a wind farm has been designed to address, in particular the role of energy use globally. The earthâs surface temperature (SST) is about -2Â°C, with several disadvantages and advantages. The overall environmental impact of a wind turbine is bound to be astronomic, and the risk of human error leading to a slow and ineffective electric current.","summarize: Renewable energy sources are discussed. These include wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy and geothermal energy. Energy from wind is acquired through the use of large wind turbines. These turbines ideally need to be located in areas where there is strong wind and low atmospheric turbulence. Solar power is collected using both photovoltaic solar cells and concentrated solar power. Energy from biomass can be produced in two ways: burning biomass to generate electricity or fermentation to produce fuel ethanol. Geothermal energy is produced by pumping water below the earthâs surface into areas of hot rocks which heats the water and creates steam. This steam is then run through a turbine to produce power.",0.32673267326732675,0.06,0.020202020202020204,0.16831683168316833,0.16831683168316833

A combination of the temperature difference from the ground to the twelfth floor of Klein Biology Tower is shown to show that the amount of solar radiation in the atmosphere is increasing with altitude in the ocean.","summarize: A simple model of the overall Earthâs heat budget is derived. The Earth is assumed to be in equilibrium with the input of solar radiation balanced by the output of infrared radiation emitted by the Earthâs surface. Using this model, the Earthâs surface temperature is calculated to be cooler than in reality due to the lack of an atmosphere and the greenhouse effect in the model.",0.45390070921985815,0.10071942446043165,0.029197080291970805,0.24113475177304963,0.24113475177304963
98,"summarize: The atmospheric greenhouse effect is introduced and discussed in greater detail. It is measured in both the measured mass and the volume of the air in the atmosphere. The calculated density of the atmosphere affected air pollutants in different parts of the world, with several disadvantages and advantages. The simplest way to assess the presence of a greenhouse effect in the climate system is through a number of measurements.","summarize: This lecture describes how pollutants mix in the atmosphere. Three cases are considered: confined mixing, unconfined mixing, and unconfined mixing with wind. In a confined volume, the concentration of pollutant in the air depends on the volume and the mass of the air present in the volume. Unconfined mixing is also known as diffusion, in which the pollutant disperses through the air from the source over time. When wind is considered, the pollutant disperses from the source in the direction of the wind. The change in temperature with height in the atmosphere is also discussed.",0.43373493975903615,0.12195121951219513,0.02469135802469136,0.3012048192771084,0.3012048192771084
99,"summarize: The greenhouse effect in the atmosphere is discussed as a mechanism for increasing atmospheric mass. The idea of a atmosphere with a non-zero density was developed by the 1960s and 1970s, which has persisted into the present day. Temperature varies steadily in this period due to the tilt of the Earthâs rotation axis between the northern and southern hemispheres. Continentality is thermodynamically favorable but below sea level. There are several factors that affect atmospheric mass and related climate. These can include the ability to change temperatures on land versus in the oceans, or the imbalance of pressure with altitude in the ocean.","summarize: The lapse rate describes the rate at which air cools with altitude. Atmospheric stability depends on the lapse rate. When an air parcel is lifted or lowered, it can continue to rise or descend based on the temperature of the surrounding air at the new altitude, which indicates an unstable atmosphere. Inversions can occur in the atmosphere, meaning the air near the ground will be cooler than air aloft. This type of temperature profile can cause air to be trapped near the Earthâs surface in a boundary layer, which can also lead to pollutants being trapped near the ground.",0.3300970873786408,0.06862745098039216,0.019801980198019806,0.17475728155339804,0.17475728155339804
100,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the rise of nationalist sentiment in the American colonies during the 1760s and 1970s. The story of this popular protest movement reaches its climax with a series of events in New Haven, demonstrating that people were prepared to fight back. In many cases, this demonstration resulted in extremely large scale rebellions, like the Boston Massacre in March 1760. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture with a discussion of a Connecticut newspaper from July 1776.","summarize: To show how Americans experienced the war and made difficult choices, Professor Freeman offers a spur-of-the-moment lecture on New Haven during the Revolution, discussing how Yale College students and New Haven townspeople gradually became caught up in the war. Warfare finally came to New Haven in July 1779 when the British army invaded the town.

101,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the differences between society in the American colonies and society in Britain after the Revolution. She begins with a discussion of the âradicalâ½� idea of the Revolution, suggesting that not all Americans live in societies that are oppressed by slavery or other forms of social order. She then discusses the more radical ideas of the Revolutionary School, suggesting how these ideas were circulating throughout society before the Revolution; and how they were being tested during the period of war. A similar theme from Boethius was discussed in the writings of Thomas Jefferson and John Stuart Mill.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the experiences of African Americans, women, and Native Americans during the Revolution, framing her discussion within a larger historical debate over whether or not the Revolution was âradical.â Freeman ultimately concludes that while white American males improved their position in society as a result of the Revolution, women, African Americans, and Native Americans did not benefit in the same ways.",0.3712574850299401,0.1212121212121212,0.03680981595092024,0.26347305389221554,0.26347305389221554
102,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the difficulties that Americans faced in the decades leading up to the Revolution, arguing that they were prepared to face a citizen army if they could willed America to survive. The American colonies began working together to resolve their problems, often competing with British colonial militias and creating new state governments that would govern themselves. Spring 1776 saw the beginnings of military conflict between the American colonies and the Continentality, with fighting between the Bostonians and the Continental Congress on March 1777. Professor Freeman then turns to a discussion of the âVirginia Planâ±,âs,â½� and discusses the radical Suffolk Resolves, a document that changed the meaning of the","summarize: This lecture discusses the ongoing political experimentation involved in creating new constitutions for the new American states. Having declared independence from Great Britain, Americans had to determine what kind of government best suited their individual states as well as the nation at large; to many, this was the âwhole objectâ of their revolutionary turmoil. Different people had different ideas about what kind of republican government would work best for their state. Should there be a unicameral or a bicameral legislature? How should political representation be organized and effected? How far should the principle of popular sovereignty be taken?",0.24644549763033177,0.019138755980861243,0.0,0.15165876777251186,0.15165876777251186
103,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the Declaration of Independence and its immediate aftermath. The lecture begins with a discussion of three central issues that raised Revolutionary America: the question of representation in the Continental Congress, the issue of slavery, and the problem of nation-state compromise. Considerable time is devoted to examining these issues. A number of scientific and historical research shows that individuals are struggling with the realities of the American Revolution and may be choosing sides in society.","summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the national debate over the proposed Constitution, arguing that in many ways, when Americans debated its ratification, they were debating the consequences and meaning of the Revolution. Some feared that a stronger, more centralized government would trample on the rights and liberties that had been won through warfare, pushing the new nation back into tyranny, monarchy, or aristocracy. The Federalist essays represented one particularly ambitious attempt to quash Anti-Federalist criticism of the Constitution. In the end, the Anti-Federalists did have one significant victory, securing a Bill of Rights to be added after the new Constitution had been ratified by the states.",0.33333333333333326,0.06521739130434784,0.03296703296703297,0.20430107526881722,0.20430107526881722
104,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the logic behind the expansion of American colonies in the late 1770s. She begins with a discussion of the rise of British colonial administration, then discusses the paradoxical nature of American colonistsâ attitudes towards the British monarchy and their recent practice of self-determination. The British assumed that the colonies were a small, informal colony group, capable of aggregating their resources and leaving behind a large, piecemeal empire. When they were unable to secure the support of the Continental Congress in October 1770, Prime Minister George Grenville instituted a new form of republican government, called the Stamp Act. Finding a shared cause in their protestations against these new British acts, Americans set the foundation for a","summarize: Professor Freeman discusses what it meant to be a British colonist in America in the eighteenth century. She explains how American colonists had deep bonds of tradition and culture with Great Britain. She argues that, as British colonists with a strong sense of their British liberties, settlers in America valued their liberties above all else. She also explains that many Americans had a sense of inferiority when they compared their colonial lifestyles to the sophistication of Europe. Professor Freeman discusses the social order in America during the eighteenth century, and suggests that the lack of an entrenched aristocracy made social rank more fluid in America than in Europe. She ends the lecture by suggesting that the great importance that American colonists placed on British liberties and their link with Britain helped pave the way",0.34509803921568627,0.07905138339920949,0.02390438247011952,0.20392156862745098,0.20392156862745098
105,"summarize: Professor Blight begins his lecture with a recap of the events leading up to World War Two, arguing that the most important reason for the warâs success was its absence from the battlefield. The central figure in the early phase of the war was President Abraham Lincoln. In his palace speech, Lincoln discusses his views on the war, suggesting that the concerted efforts of northern Peace Democrats and a palpable war wear out by the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress on August 17, 1863, and the decisive victory at Gettysburg in July of 1863. Although Lincoln made one final attempt at reconciliation during the campaign, Congressional Republicans and President Lincoln managed to work together on two vital pieces of the Civil War agenda:","summarize: After finishing with his survey of the manner in which historians have explained the coming of the Civil War, Professor Blight focuses on Fort Sumter. After months of political maneuvering, the Civil War began when Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, in the harbor outside Charleston, SC. The declaration of hostilities prompted four more statesâVirginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arkansasâto secede. Professor Blight closes the lecture with a brief discussion of some of the forces that motivated AmericansâNorth and Southâto go to war.",0.3207547169811321,0.08571428571428572,0.028846153846153844,0.19811320754716982,0.19811320754716982
106,"summarize: Professor Blight begins the lecture with an introduction to the history of African Americans. The catalyst for the development of the modern United States was President Abraham Lincoln, a Virginia slave whose concerted efforts to control the passage of the Civil Rights bill by Congressional Republicans radically altered the meaning of the war forever. The Congressional elections in November of 1862, coupled with the Presidential election of 1860, cemented a political division between the North and South that has persisted into the twenty-first century. The lecture concludes with a discussion of Hattonâs radical ideas about race in society, lynchings, and the denial of citizenship.","summarize: This lecture focuses on the process of emancipation after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. The Proclamation, Professor Blight suggests, had four immediate effects: it made the Union army an army of emancipation; it encouraged slaves to strike against slavery; it committed the US to a policy of emancipation in the eyes of Europe; and it allowed African Americans to enlist in the Union Army. In the end, ten percent of Union soldiers would be African American. A number of factors, Professor Blight suggests, combined to influence the timing of emancipation in particular areas of the South, including geography, the nature of the slave society, and the proximity of the Union army.",0.375,0.07207207207207206,0.018181818181818184,0.24107142857142855,0.24107142857142855

The key figures in this text are, as we see it in the poem, â½ a narrative about the emergence of a new man, Dick Preston, from the Easton Community College, a young black writer published in 1845, a collection of vignettes published in the same year that launched the Civil War. In the concluding chapters of the book, Professor Freeman discusses the lives of William Wordsworth and John C. Fremont, a Virginia slave whose concerted action suggests a near-admired view of history, one that seems to oppose","summarize: Professor Blight discusses the rise of abolitionism. Blight begins with an introduction to the genre of slave narratives, with particular attention to Frederick Douglassâ 1845 narrative. The lecture then moves on to discuss the culture in which antebellum reform grewâthe factors that encouraged its growth, as well as those that retarded it. Professor Blight then describes the movement towards radical abolitionism, stopping briefly on colonization and gradualism before introducing the character and ideology of William Lloyd Garrison.",0.35602094240837695,0.06349206349206349,0.0106951871657754,0.1884816753926702,0.1884816753926702

What was the meaning of this revolution and what could have been thought of as a revolutionary one? Professor Blight begins with a discussion of the nature and role of monarchy in society. He then considers the competing claims of the Bundestag and the Orleanists in their own right, along with an expanding national government characterized by respect to women and African Americans.","summarize: Revolutions occur when a critical mass of people come together to make specific demands upon their government. They invariably involve an increase in popular involvement in the political process. One of the central questions concerning 1848, a year in which almost every major European nation faced a revolutionary upsurge, is why England did not have its own revolution despite the existence of social tensions. Two principal reasons account for this fact: first, the success of reformist political measures, and the existence of a non-violent Chartist movement; second, the elaboration of a British self-identity founded upon a notion of respectability.

109,"summarize: If the history of World War I is marked by a defining event, so too is the nature of its remembrance. Indeed, many human history events take place in Europe during this period, and many features of the war are still missing. The Thirty Years Peace was negotiated despite the competing claims of nationalism and cosmopolitanism. In fact, thousands of people would be affected by the war, and it is important to distinguish between valuable lessons and warnings for future generations.","summarize: As a result of World War I, Europe had a different understanding of war in the twentieth century than the United States. One of the most important ways in which the First World War was experienced on the continent and in Britain was through commemoration. By means of both mass-media technologies and older memorial forms, sites of memory offered opportunities for personal as well as political reconciliation with the unprecedented consequences of the war. The influence of these sites is still felt today, in a united Europe, as the importance of armies has diminished in favor of social welfare programs.",0.31521739130434784,0.054945054945054944,0.033333333333333326,0.21739130434782608,0.21739130434782608
110,"summarize: In this final lecture of the course, Professor Merriman discusses the conflicts that led up to World War I. He explains why the Boy Scouts were formed in the early years of the twentieth century, arguing that they were a necessary step in the development of American imperialism. In fact, many American citizens joined together to fight alongside their Soviet counterparts at the Battle of Saratoga in 1918. The fighting between the army and colonial militias culminated in a number of mutinies at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, fought in Vietnam. In addition to the wars against the Persians and Demoiselles, this lecture also presents a brief summary of some of the conflicts concerning trench warfare in Europe between 1917 and 1919.","summarize: The course will concern European history from 1648 to 1945.

111,"summarize: In the decades immediately following World War II, the tensions between France and Germany over the future of the war slowly escalated. The Treaty of Versailles was negotiated, but the situation became increasingly fraught after the warâs end. The hopelessness of the Popular Front government at the Parisian center was underscored. The Popular Front would rule in a largely Christian direction, but they would be weakened by rightwing agrarian and fascist political parties. This instability would find a ready outlet in the form of increasingly acrimonious resistance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the tension between communist revolutionaries and socialist reformers resulted in civil unrest.","summarize: Contrary to the âGreat Illusionâ that the end of World War I heralded a new era of peace, the interwar period can be considered to form part of a Thirty Yearsâ War, spanning the period from 1914 to 1945. In the wake of the Treaty of Versailles, Europe was divided both literally and figuratively, with the so-called revisionist powers frustrated over their new borders. One of the most significant and ultimately most pernicious debates at Versailles concerned the identity of states with ethnic majorities.

112,"summarize: The rise of Gorbachev in Russia is often said to have been entirely overshadowed by that of his Soviet predecessors. However, this analysis is inaccurate because it ignores the significance of the events of the Cold War. Indeed, even after the massive cultural and political transformation brought on by the nuclear tests of the Chernobyl nuclear tests, many people in Russia opposed the idea of revising the Soviet constitution. Gorbovâs state sponsored a cultural flowering, based in part on the translation of classical Greek and Roman texts. This theme is explored in detail with reference to the figure of Leon Blum, a Russian scholar whose work focuses on the psychology of individuals rather than the question of who governs Russia.","summarize: The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted from a number of different factors. Three important ones are nationalism among Soviet satellite states, democratic opposition movements, and economic crisis. Along with these elements, the role of Mikhail Gorbachev should not be discounted. Although his attempt to reform communism was rejected, his reformist positions as Soviet premier helped open the way for full-fledged political dissidence. One of the major challenges faced by Europe in the wake of the collapse of communism has been that posed by ethnic nationalism, a problem that erupted violently in the Balkans in the 1990s.

Although they may seem hopelessly weak in the long view of history, enduring popular discontent resulted in large scale rebellions and short-lived rebellions.Â The problem of civil unrest appears to have been resolved early in the","summarize: The rise of absolutism in Europe must be understood in the context of insecurity attending the religious wars of the first half of the seventeenth century, and the Thirty Yearsâ War in particular. Faced with the unprecedented brutality and devastation of these conflicts, European nobles and landowners were increasingly willing to surrender their independence to the authority of a single, all-powerful monarch in return for guaranteed protection. Among the consequences of this consolidation of state power were the formation of large standing armies and bureaucratic systems, the curtailment of municipal privileges, and the birth of international law.",0.32142857142857145,0.04504504504504505,0.0,0.1875,0.1875

He contrasts the political landscape of the Netherlands with the political scene in England, and highlights the remarkable diversity of people living in both locations. London experienced a peak population growth in the nineteenth century, but it was only because of the growth of manufacturing industries like coal production and oil extraction that new ones were being formed. The Dutch state sponsored a cultural flowering, based in part on the translation of classical Greek and Roman texts. However, this culture was strained by the local activism of many English people. These movements resulted in a high-pitched rhetoric of disease and decay, as ideas concerning urbanization and the role of cities","summarize: Several reasons can be found to explain why Great Britain and the Netherlands did not follow the other major European powers of the seventeenth century in adopting absolutist rule. Chief among these were the presence of a relatively large middle class, with a vested interest in preserving independence from centralized authority, and national traditions of resistance dating from the English Civil War and the Dutch war for independence from Spain, respectively. In both countries anti-absolutism formed part of a sense of national identity, and was linked to popular anti-Catholicism.

116,"summarize: The Enlightenment movement in France is often said to have been entirely overshadowed by the Enlightenment. However, this analysis is inaccurate because it ignores the significance of events such as the execution of Louis XIV. Indeed, it was the nineteenth century, and many people who lived through the Revolution believed that there could be many more lasting effects in the society than a secular one. These ideas were based on the writings of Voltaire and other modernists. Although they may be revisionist in some ways, the ultimate lesson of the Revolution on the part of liberals, socialists, and some Republicans in particular, is that the voices of the working classes, rather than those of the Enlightenment, would sometimes shout out from the living world.","summarize: While the major philosophical projects of the Enlightenment are associated with the names of individual thinkers such as Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, the cultural transformation in France in the years leading up to the Revolution should also be understood in the context of the public sphere and popular press. Alongside such luminaries as those associated with DiderotâsÂ Â were a host of lesser pamphleteers and libellists eager for fame and some degree of fortune.

The role played by various personalities at the Parisian Enlightenment, together with the late politics of Leon Blum, contribute to the fragmentation of the early twentieth century.","summarize: Robespierreâs ascetic personal life and severe philosophy of political engagement are attributed by some to his difficult childhood. As a revolutionary, one of his most significant insights was that the Revolution was threatened not only by Franceâs military adversaries abroad, but also by domestic counter-revolutionaries. Under this latter heading were gathered two major groups, urban mercantilists and rural peasants.

Although Napoleon himself would later disavow his earlier identification with the island in favor of French identity, many of his actions and attitudes agree with stereotypical notions of Corsican culture. Did Napoleon inaugurate the era of total war? This question, posed in a recent book, is up for debate.

The Christian Church of the Holy Land is most pertinent to a discussion of the political and social landscape of the Roman empire.Â At the beginning of the period covered in this course, there were three major groups in the west: Shiism, Islam, and Northern Nigeria. Although these groups were based in the previously Roman East, they represented a deeply Eurocentric view of history. In addition to an eclectic mix of theology and philosophy, they also share a wide variety of rituals and viewpoints.Â In the third century these ideas appeared to have been interpreted by many as indicative of a post-modern form.Â However","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Freedman introduces Islam. He begins with a discussion of its geographical context: the dry desert lands of the Arabian peninsula. The Bedouins, or nomadic Arabs of the region, lived in a tribal society somewhat similar to the Germanic tribes discussed earlier in the course.Â Their raids against the Byzantine and the Persian Empire, for lack of strong opposition, would lead to the Arab conquests.

In a relatively short period of time, the Arabs were able to conquer an area stretching from Spain to India.Â Against this background of successful conquests, Islam began to experience deep internal divisions.

However, under Justinian the Carolingian dynasty, Christian Europe experienced a decline in the fifth century, especially after the Turkish withdrawal.Â Increasingly faced with external threats, the Eastern Empire experienced a significant ideological division between it and the West.Â The crisis over Byzantium culminated in the decline of the Vandals and Visigoths in the first part of the century.

122,"summarize: Professor Wrightson reviews the three major public health movements of the nineteenth century, all in an effort to assess the role of public health in the social and political crises of the period. The first of these was the reign of Oliver Cromwell, a reformer brought on by Charles VIII of France who aimed to control the growth of the state through a series of measures called the Trolley Problem. While these measures were successful, they belong to a long list of lessons from previous policy areas, and many of these lessons are still being drawn from the earlier eras.","summarize: The sanitary movement was an approach to public health first developed in England in the 1830s and â40s. With increasing industrialization and urbanization, the removal of filth from towns and cities became a major focus in the struggle against infectious diseases. As pioneered by Edwin Chadwick, the sanitary movement also embraced an explicit political objective, according to which urban cleansing took on a figurative as well as a literal sense, and was seen as a potential solution to the threat posed by the âdangerous classes.â European cities followed suit, with Paris and Naples embarking on wholesale rebuilding projects, necessitating large-scale state intervention.

123,"summarize: In the nineteenth century, tuberculosis was understood as a major disease. The disease arrived in Europe in the form of three major eras: the hoplite class, the social/emergionist mode, and the epidemiologic mode of transmission. In the tropical world, tuberculosis experienced a peak concentration in the 1820s, corresponding with increasing resistance to conventional treatments. A wide range of ineffective and often dangerous treatments were put into place to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including intravenous drug use, and bloodletting and the introduction of antiseptics. Successive scientists and physicians had questioned the exclusive commitment of medicine to improving public health worldwide.","summarize: The cultural transition from the romantic era of consumption to the era of tuberculosis derived not only from the germ theory of disease and the triumph of contagionism over anticontagionism, but also from political considerations. Worries over population decline and growing working-class militancy were aggravated by what now appeared to be a social disease, or a disease of poverty. One of the strategies deployed against the disease was the sanatorium, an institution which was capable both of instructing patients in contagionism and in imposing a practical quarantine. Although the development of effective chemotherapy in the 1940s raised hopes that tuberculosis might be globally eradicated, these have unfortunately proven to be overly optimistic.

124,"summarize: The human impact of plague on European society is discussed. An analysis of the historical events leading up to the Civil War reveals that, in the period immediately following the war, people lived with plague as well as a deep-rooted fear of death. This fear would find a ready outlet in society, where the devastation wrought by plague severely impedes public health and religious toleration. In the wake of the second civil war, public authorities began working together to contain the spread of Christianity and to protect citizens from further infection. However, this collaboration resulted in a number of ineffective and often dangerous measures aimed at keeping plague secret from the public.","summarize: One of the major cultural consequences of the second plague pandemic was its effect on attitudes towards death and the âart of dying.â As a result both of its extreme virulence and the strictness of the measures imposed to combat it, plague significantly disrupted traditional customs of dealing with death. This disruption made itself felt not only in religious belief and burial practices but also in art, architecture and literature.

125,"summarize: The impact of smallpox on human history is profound. In the eighteenth century, smallpox had a major impact on European culture. This impact was evident in urban areas where smallpox was endemic, or eradicated. The disease spread slowly in rural areas, and was capable of reducing the seemingly healthy population of any individual within a city. The dread associated with smallpox resulted in a reciprocal cycle of poverty and infection, low productivity and the desertion of profitable land weakening societiesâ ability to combat the disease and ultimately reinforcing a division between the global North (where smallpox developed a ready-made cure for the disease) and Europe (where it was eradicated following the Second World War). One result of","summarize: It is not known for certain when smallpox first appeared in Europe; however, the disease reached its highpoint in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it persisted as an endemic disease while periodically erupting as an epidemic. European literature testifies to the pervasiveness of smallpox, a disease that most would have had acquired in childhood. In the New World, the disease was experienced very differently.

This has been closely documented in terms of the rise of nationalist sentiment in France, as well as a decline in traditional forms of expression.

Although there have been celebrated attempts to address this problem, such as Zola, it is only in the past five or ten years that the government has seriously tried to tackle the problem of alcoholism.

From the destructive power of lust within the private world of the court, Dante moves on to the effects of its sister sin,",0.36936936936936937,0.06363636363636364,0.0,0.23423423423423423,0.23423423423423423

The problem of evil in the Gospel of Luke is discussed, and Professor Gaius Canto VIII introduces Dante as a modernist historian. The problems inherit inÂ Â XXIV-XXVI, where Dante dissolves the classical argument about immorality and asceticism by accepting the immortality of the soul. This lecture concludes with a brief summary of the lives of Alecto and Megaera (Â XXX) and proceeds with an exploration of theodicy.","summarize: In this lecture, Professor Mazzotta discussesÂ Â IX-XI. An impasse at the entrance to the City of Dis marks Virgilâs first failure in his role as guide (Â IX). The invocation of Medusa by the harpies that descend while they wait for divine aid elicits Danteâs first address to the reader. The question of literary mediation, posed in the previous lecture in the context ofÂ Â V, is explored further, and the distinction Dante draws between the âallegory of poetsâ and the âallegory of theologiansâ�",0.4419889502762431,0.1005586592178771,0.05649717514124294,0.27624309392265195,0.27624309392265195

The pilgrimâs encounter with Dante in theÂ, a dialogue taking place on the terraces of nature, poetry, and history, is examined at length. The novelty of this dialogue with Dante is tied to the relationship he discovers between art and myth, with particular emphasis placed on the poem-long consideration of its biblical and historical context. The following cantos are read with special attention to the poetics of chiasmic monotheism pursued by Dante. At the beginning ofÂ Vigne, Dante moves from the exemplars of the active life to the contemplative spirits of","summarize: This lecture focuses on the middle zone of Inferno, the area of violence (Â XII-XVI). Introductory remarks are made on the concentration of hybrid creatures in this area of Hell and followed by a close reading of cantos XIII and XV. The pilgrimâs encounter with Pier delle Vigne (Â XIII) is placed in literary context (Â III). The questioning of authority staged in this scene resurfaces in the circle of sodomy (Â XV), where the pilgrimâs encounter with his teacher, Brunetto Latini, is read as a critique of the humanistic values he embodied.",0.4444444444444444,0.10204081632653061,0.030927835051546393,0.2222222222222222,0.2222222222222222

In theÂ Â XVIII, Dante enters the city of Florence with Guelfus, a pagan suicide who is determined to destroy the Roman Empire by detaching himself from his divine wife by grounding himself in the divine Dionysus. This contrast is illustrated by the pilgrimâs ascent into the Domus Aurea, the heaven of treachery, and the palace of Ghibelles, where Marco Lombardo is seen to embody the virtues of exile, setting an example for the penitent souls of Hell. The irony, however, is that this perverse love story reaches","summarize: This lecture deals primarily with Cantos XIX and XXVI ofÂ. Simony, the sin punished inÂ Â XIX, is situated historically to point out the contiguity of the sacred and the profane and its relevance to the prophetic voice Dante established in this canto. The fine line between prophecy and profanation is shown to resurface inÂ Â XXIV and XXV, where the poet falls prey, as did the pilgrim inÂ Â IV, to poetic hubris.

The events ofÂ ixIX and XXXVI are introduced and the ways in which knowledge of the past is communicated through Danteâs denunciations of Cato, a pagan suicide, is explored. In theÂ vernacular language of Cato (Â XXVII), Dante recalls Cato and his kinship with the great monarchs at the threshold of Mount Purgatory.

142,"summarize: Until recently, the world population has been growing faster than exponentially. The growth of the population has slowed somewhat but slowed somewhat in recent years. The current population is about 1.35 billion a year and will probably increase more beyond that. The high fertility projection assumes that the population will decrease dramatically by 2050. Fertility will remain high and then rise to 450ppm by the year 2100. The enormous excess of children in this population is known as the âremaindersâ² of history. However, many humans are aging and the baby boomers will have a larger, older family to support them in the future.","summarize: World population will continue to rise until at least 2050. Environmental impact is the product of the number of people and how much of their income and technology is devoted to either consumption or conservation. So far, the balance is far at the consumption end and, globally, environmental problems are increasing. Environmentalism has not come close to counteracting the footprint of a billion extra people every dozen years. The only massive success has been the decline in global fertility. People want fewer children, the contraceptive technology is available, and the cost is minimal. The only realistic possibility for ameliorating the environmental crisis might be to facilitate the continued decline of fertility.",0.36866359447004604,0.05581395348837209,0.0,0.18433179723502302,0.18433179723502302
143,"summarize: In ancient societies, population grows rapidly and then die out suddenly. The loss of fertility is dealt with by infanticide in many cultures. However, the growth of populations in more primitive societies can still occur. Populations are subject to large-scale rebellions, such as those in Africa. If the population grows faster than an increase in fertility, then the problem of poverty will be resolved. However this involves a high-pitched rhetoric of âwe cannot control our fertility.â² At the end of life, ancestors turn into great monarchs.","summarize: In many regions, the central cultural idea is that of a lineage, a family and its line of male ancestors and descendants. The prime duty in these cultures is to keep the lineage going. Religion is small scale with the ancestors performing many of the functions of gods. Denser populations and larger political entities lead to large-scale religion where conformity is stressed and cultural rules are codified in a book and not subject to discussion with the ancestors. In pre-modern Sub-Saharan Africa, land was not limiting, so a maximum number of children was desired. Neither monogamy nor chastity were valued as much as fertility.

The âDiscourse on Religionâ spread throughout Europe in the period between the 1560s and the present, presenting an overview of the conflicts that led up to the Protestant Reformation. Themes discussed include religion, interpretation of the Bible, and a belief in the power of prayer.","summarize: European populations grew only slowly during the period 1200-1700; factors include disease and wars. Human feces and rotting animal remains were not sequestered and often contaminated drinking water. Cities were so filthy that more people died in them than were born. About a third of children died in infancy, many from abandonment and lack of care during wet-nursing. Children that survived were subjected to harsh discipline to control their tendency to sin.

145,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the two major trends in world population growth in the eighteenth century. The first trend was the expansion of the British monarchy, a growth which had resulted in a greatly increased national income and a greatly reduced population. However, population also fell dramatically and was subject to climatic-related restrictions. The second trend was more draconian, led by the forces of James Madison and John Stuart Mill. Despite these factors, population levels rose steadily in spite of the fact that they were expanding.","summarize: Prior to Malthus, population growth was seen as good for the power and wealth of a country. The rapid population growth of America was crucial in expelling England (via the Revolution) and France (via the Louisiana Purchase) from the US. But in fact, the numbers of the poor were growing in Europe in the 1700s. Malthus argued that poverty was due to an imbalance between people and resources; since population could rise very fast, it could always outstrip any gains in productivity. He did not anticipate an exponential increase in production or a voluntary decrease in fertility. However, Malthusâ thinking is still important because high population levels and environmental limitations are in fact problematic today.",0.3645320197044335,0.03980099502487563,0.0,0.17733990147783252,0.17733990147783252
146,"summarize: Families lived together in traditional European countries and sons remained on the land; division of family land led to tiny plots and rural poverty. Because labor was so cheap, the country did not urbanize or mechanize. The problem of population control, or lack of contraception, was resolved by the early medieval church. Fertility declined rapidly in the 1620s, but to counteract momentum, the Church of England started a fertility program dedicated to keeping the fertility below replacement. Comparing the Demographic Transition in Europe and in Japan, fertility dropped dramatically in the latter half of the 20 century, but continued to rise until the 1930s.","summarize: Prior to the Demographic Transition, fertility in northwestern Europe was controlled by limiting marriage. Marriage was regulated by landowners and the churches, and was not allowed unless a man had accumulated the resources necessary to support a family. Long periods of being landless, a servant, or an apprentice, precluded marriage. Once married, there was no control of fertility. But, only about half of adults were married at any given time, so fertility was about half of what it might have been. Eventually, contraception was accepted and fertility within marriage fell. Society no longer needed to control marriage so tightly and marriage rates rose dramatically. The options of marriage, sex and childbearing passed from community control to individual control.

The question is raised, however, whether souls exist or not. The answer to the question is âwhat does it mean for a person to be different?â². What is the meaning of this question and how can we reconcile it?","summarize: Two more views regarding the metaphysical key to personal identity are discussed: the body view and the personality view.

Then we consider a number of arguments that may be offered as proof that the existence of a person is worth living, and some alternative explanations for its existence. One popular theory is hedonism, but this view is inadequate because it assigns value to being alive itself and it assigns strain to those who are dead. This lecture then turns to a consideration of some alternative theories of the nature of well-being. What makes a person different from a body? What is it that matters in survival?","summarize: The lecture explores the question of the state of being dead. Even though the most logical claim seems to be that when a person stops P-functioning he or she is dead, a more careful consideration must allow for exceptions, such as when one is asleep or in a coma.

A concluding summary of the course is offered.","summarize: This is the first of a series of lectures on suicide. Two very distinct contexts are presented in which the subject can be further explored. The first is rationality and the question of under what circumstances it makes sense to end oneâs own life. The second is morality and the question of whether we can ever ethically justify resorting to suicide.

The emphasis here is on the fact that we need to believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will. This is an argument dualists use as an objection to the physicalists: since no merely physical entity could have free will, there must be more to us than just being a physical object.",0.36257309941520466,0.09467455621301775,0.03592814371257485,0.23391812865497075,0.23391812865497075

Professor Kagan then turns to the third and final topic of the lecture, âthe question of whether we have free will.â¯ A number of problems are posed which challenge the belief that we have Free will. The first topic is the idea that we must consider non-physical objects in order to construct the universe.

The argument consists of three premises: 1) We have free will. 2) Nothing subject to determinism has free will. 3) All purely physical systems are subject to determinism. The conclusion drawn from this is that humans are not a purely physical system; but Professor Kagan explains why this argument is not truly compelling.

In contrast to Rawls, who puts justice at the center of his theory, Nozick maintains that the primary notion should be rights or liberties.

155,"summarize: The lecture discusses the issue of legitimacy and how it is legitimate for a government to engage in social contractions. Professor Gendler begins by exploring Hobbesâ central claims: that because there are many things that can be accomplished by taking as a factual form the human beings are capable of aggregating these events. This theme then moves to Hobbesian terms, with particular emphasis placed on the notion that all life consists of going and coming back, and this involves reconciling the desires of both individuals and communities. Hobbes, in contrast to consequentialism, argues that it is enough to have a government that is capable of dealing with large numbers in some situations.","summarize: Professor Gendler explores some aspects of the question of what sorts of non-rational persuasion are legitimate for a government to engage in. She begins with two modern examples that illustrate Platoâs view on state censorship. She next turns to the text itself and outlines in detail Platoâs argument that since we are vulnerable to non-rational persuasion, and since a powerful source of such persuasion is imitative poetry, such poetry must be censored by the state.

159,"summarize: In this final lecture on the Republic, Professor Donald Kagan discusses Aristotleâs claim that there are two virtues according to which the soul can be thought of as reflective beings. On the one hand, there is the capacity to delay gratification by taking pleasure in the virtuous act; on the other hand, it is a third virtue that must be considered in light of the existence of different forms of happiness. At the end of the lecture, Professor Kagan turns to Julia Annas and presents a summary of what the Greeks wrote in response to these developments.","summarize: Professor Gendler introduces Aristotleâs conception of virtue as a structuring oneâs life so that oneâs instinctive responses line up with oneâs reflective commitments. Becoming virtuous, according to Aristotle, requires that we engage in a process of habituation by acting as if we were virtuous, just as musicians master their instruments by playing them. By contrast, when oneâs behavior or experience is out of line with oneâs reflective commitments, dissonance ensues.

172,"summarize: John Locke, a liberal thinker and near-contemporary of the conservative Hobbes, published in 1688 with an emphasis on the idea that government is a kind of social institution, not a government that can be characterized by executive power - a key element of Lockeâs state. The lecture begins with a discussion of the natural liberty and equality of human beings. Locke, as a political and social thinker, starts his state with a strong emphasis on property rights and the right of subjects to transfer their allegiance to a new sovereign if the ruler does not provide for their own sake. Unlike most early modernists, Locke argues that property must be kept in check and balance, and that without a government, a","summarize: John Locke had such a profound influence on Thomas Jefferson that he may be deemed an honorary founding father of the United States. He advocated the natural equality of human beings, their natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and defined legitimate government in terms that Jefferson would later use in the Declaration of Independence. Lockeâs life and works are discussed, and the lecture shows how he transformed ideas previously formulated by Machiavelli and Hobbes into a more liberal constitutional theory of the state.John Locke, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection",0.45248868778280543,0.10958904109589042,0.027649769585253458,0.2171945701357466,0.2171945701357466
173,"summarize: In this lecture Professor Freeman discusses Tocquevilleâs problem with state legitimacy and the emergence of new democratic societies. She begins with an introduction to the historical context of the political movement, which began seriously in the seventeenth century and continued in the eighteenth centuries. The conflicts emerging from the French Enlightenment, coupled with the ongoing struggle for power amongst competing political factions in Europe, lead to the development of the modern state of nature. At the same time, these developments also entailed a significant ideological compromise and a deeply Eurocentric view of the people. In the wake of the French civil wars, many questions concerning freedom and equality were posed, including whether or not individuals should be allowed to exercise their","summarize: With the emergence of democracies in Europe and the New World at the beginning of the nineteenth century, political philosophers began to re-evaluate the relationship between freedom and equality. Tocqueville, in particular, saw the creation of new forms of social power that presented threats to human liberty. His most famous work, Democracy in America, was written for his French countrymen who were still devoted to the restoration of the monarchy and whom Tocqueville wanted to convince that the democratic social revolution he had witnessed in America was equally representative of Franceâs future.Alexis de Tocqueville,, trans.

174,"summarize: Professor Blight discusses the role of civic association in American democracy. The discussion begins with an account of the founding of the Republic and then discusses the importance of it in the democratic experience. The idea that, in the context of modern society, public servants must respect and live by the laws of the community; this theme is explored in the writings of Robert Putnam and John Stuart Mill. The lecture then turns to a discussion of the decline of Tocqueville as a place of civic organization, a decline realized in the United States on August 28. The general will, or âprecepts of reason,â²â� is considered in light of the recent decline","summarize: Three main features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy are discussed: the importance of local government, the concept of âcivil association,â and âthe spirit of religion.â The book is not simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America; Tocqueville is deeply worried about the potential of a democratic tyranny.Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, trans.

175,"summarize: Professor Freeman discusses the transformation of Tocquevilleâs society from a democracy to a democracy. The transformation took place under the leadership of Montesquieu and his sons, who desired to preserve the power of their nation by assuring civil peace and security. In the absence of a strong government, Montesque developed a plan for dealing with the problem of securing individual liberty and equality. Among these measures, he develops a set of manners and morality that are often deemed paradoxical. On the one hand, these manners may seem reasonable; on the other hand, they may be more or less as well. This element is explored in light of the historical events of this century.Jean-","summarize: Professor Smith discusses the moral and psychological components of the democratic state in the context of Tocquevilleâs Democracy in America. He goes on to explore the institutional development of the democratic state, the qualities of the democratic individual, and the psychological determinants of the democratic character.

Professor Brownell reviews methods to track food intake, from a population level to an individual level, emphasizing methods and measurement error as well as portion underestimation. The definition of a calorie and how it is measured are also discussed, as well as peopleâs changing relationships with macronutrients and micronutrients in food and with water.",0.24242424242424243,0.04123711340206185,0.021052631578947364,0.18181818181818182,0.18181818181818182
189,"summarize: This lecture begins with a continued consideration of the apocalyptic literature of the Bible, including the book of Haman. The catalyst for the development of apocalyptic literature was Mordechaiâs resolve to do away with Haman and establish non-mythological communities. Haman is a reformer of the moral theology of the ancient church, but this time he does so in order to ensure that the wicked are punished. This lecture concludes with a reading of the word in enjambment and treachery.","summarize: In this lecture, two final books of the Bible are examined and their attitudes towards foreign nations compared. In contrast to Danielâs reliance on divine intervention to punish the wicked, the book of Esther focuses on human initiative in defeating the enemies of Israel. Finally, the book of Jonahâin which the wicked Assyrians repent and are spared divine punishmentâexpresses the view that God is compassionate and concerned with all creation.

190,"summarize: The New Testament is a library of sayings, or logia, that sometimes seem similar but differ very little from the Bible. Sometimes, sayings differ at all or may be more complex than sayings found in the Bible; other times, they seem more like sayings of praise and thanksgiving. How do we understand these differences? A historical critical reading of the Bible does not force these sayings into a harmonious unity or accept them at face value. They present a pro-family, anti-ascetic message that emphasizes the rejection of the material world and an embrace of the divine being.","summarize: This course approaches the New Testament not as scripture, or a piece of authoritative holy writing, but as a collection of historical documents. Therefore, students are urged to leave behind their pre-conceived notions of the New Testament and read it as if they had never heard of it before. This involves understanding the historical context of the New Testament and imagining how it might appear to an ancient person.",0.29239766081871343,0.047337278106508875,0.011976047904191616,0.19883040935672514,0.19883040935672514
191,"summarize: This lecture focuses on the politics of early Christianity. It begins with an introduction to the Romans, John XXIV-XXVI. The focus remains on the Politics of Revelation, with emphasis placed on the book of John. The writer of Revelation seems to have been a proto-Nazi himself, but the terms âhistoricalâ±â= XXIV.âIV), referring to the works of Ignatius of Antioch, and moving on to discuss the specifics of the church and its structure. The major themes ofÂ, such as opposition to monarchy, equality, and fraternity, are explored.","summarize: The Apocalypse of John showed an anti-Roman, politically revolutionary perspective. This is in contrast with Paulâs writing in Romans 13, which calls for submission to governmental authorities - although passages in 1 Corinthians may be said to contradict this. 2 Thessalonians, a pseudonymous letter, also preaches a politically conservative and accommodative message, as does 1 Peter. Interestingly, these letters do not discard or ignore apocalypticism but use it quite differently from the author of Revelation to further their message of political conservatism. 2 Peter seems to be a letter dating from the second century, from the post-apostolic age. In 2 Peter, the apocalypse is no longer imminent and is not",0.2758620689655173,0.029850746268656712,0.0,0.17733990147783252,0.17733990147783252

This small movement saw many changes in the second, third, and fourth centuries, from the development of different sects, philosophical theologies, and martyrology, to the rise of monasticism, and finally to the ascension of Constantine to the throne and the Christian Roman Empire.

193,"summarize: The Gospel of Luke contains many features and themes similar to that in the Gospel of Mark. It also presents a narrative quite similar to those in Luke, but it also speaks of a writer, rather than a story about a text, or a collection of sayings. The Gospel is full of long dialogues not taken at face value as historical narratives, and it seems to be written in a tradition of epic poetry like the Gospel. At the lectureâs conclusion, a moving account of what was happening in Luke is presented, with Jesus as the author.","summarize: Luke and Acts, a two-volume work, are structured very carefully by the author to outline the ministry of Jesus and the spread of the Gospel to the gentiles. The Gospel of Luke emphasizes the themes of Jesusâ Jewish piety, his role as a rejected prophet, and the reversal of earthly status. The Gospel ends in Jerusalem, and the Acts of the Apostles begins there and then follows the spread of the Gospel, both conceptually and geographically, to Samaria and the gentiles. By closely analyzing the Gospel and Acts, we see that the author was not concerned with historicity or chronological order.

Through a closer look at Marxâs âTheses on Feuerbach,â we discuss different theories of truth with attention to the questions of where truth resides (in the subject, in the object, or some combination), how we know it, and how we know when we know it. Arguing for his conception of materialism, Marx argues that truth is not simply the reflection of the object in the mind of the subject; we must access truth",0.11111111111111112,0.04838709677419354,0.016393442622950817,0.11111111111111112,0.11111111111111112
195,"summarize: We return to Max Weberâs theory of critical scrutiny. The cornerstone of his theory is the idea that individuals live in society and can be trusted with power and domination. We turn to a discussion of the value and limitations of his theories, and how they are related to Marxâs theory. In the context of this discussion, we turn to Freudâunderstanding ourselves in time and placeâand examine our attitudes about history and contemporary history.Â We consider the emergence of concepts of freedom and justice in society, taking them from Marx and Freud to discuss their ideas in detail.","summarize: Max Weber wrote his best-known work after he recovered from a period of serious mental illness near the turn of the twentieth century. After he recovered, his work transitioned from enthusiastically capitalist and liberal in the tradition of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill to much more skeptical of the down-sides of modernization, more similar to the thinking of Nietzsche and Freud. In his first major work,, Weber argues that the Protestant faith, especially Lutherâs notion of âcallingâ and the Calvinist belief in predestination set the stage for the emergence of the capitalist spirit.

196,"summarize: Durkheim understood life sciences as divided into three different strains of authority: legal-rational authority and capitalism. The oldest of these is functional division of laborâthat is, we construct a system of government based on laws and norms. The second is a theory of political and social regulation. InÂ, Durkett argues that in addition to the traditional forms of authority, there can be many more powerful and capable powers.","summarize: The purest formâthe ideal typeâof Weberâs legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens",0.36756756756756753,0.04371584699453552,0.011049723756906077,0.23783783783783782,0.23783783783783782
197,"summarize: The discussion of the GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a continues, referring to the events that constitute the end of theÂ, which constitute thematic treatises on virtually every topic. The presence of characters in the novel is explored sequentially, beginning with the first part (1605) and continuing with increasing emphasis on the charactersâ seeming inability to recollect any of the events ofÂ. This lecture then moves to the present, commenting on the legacy of the penitent souls of the medieval nuns of Avellaneda. The novelty of these events is here to continue the tradition of reading literature out loud, with allusions to the works of Homer and Platonism.","summarize: GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a starts by commenting on three of the returns and repetitions (characters who reappear and incidents that, if not repeated, recall previous incidents) that take place at the end of part one of theÂ Â and which give density to the fiction: the galley slaves, AndrÃ©s, and the postprandial speech or the speech on arms and letters.

She begins with a discussion of the poemâs title, a dialogue taking place in part I between the characters of the prodigal son and the ontological realm of the Greek world. This dialogue is then placed in the context of Part I: the rise of theÂ, the descent of the â±, and the descent into the pit of Hell.

The discussion of Don Quixote and Sancho about knight-errants and saints is not only about arms and letters, but about good actions for their own sake and for the sake of glory (or deceit). This discussion echoes the religious debates of the time and shows Don Quixoteâs broad knowledge of them, anticipating Part IIâs projection beyond Spain.

199,"summarize: In this part of the, GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a starts referring to the episode of Camacho, which may well be seen as a representation of the whole book. The charactersâ dissatisfaction with the traditional forms of literature they are seen to follow leads to the emergence of new literary forms, such as the modern novel, the collection of vignettes published in 1605 that exemplify the ambitions of the penitent love tradition pursued by the baroque.

The episode, a form of epithalamium based on the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, states one of the main themes of part two, that art corrects nature. As a way of turning deceit, which would normally lead to disillusionment, into a happy ending, in Camachoâs wedding episode art helps nature to attain good ending.

This short novel contains many of the themes and issues raised by theÂ, most famously posed by the pilgrim Guido Guinizelli, that are explored in the context of the Renaissance. In the second part of the lecture, Professor Mazzotta comments on the similarities and differences between literature and life, the question of what constitutes a masterpiece, and the answer to what","summarize: Why does the Â have such common currency today? GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a believes that theÂ Â is about the effect that literature has on its readers and about the creation of literature. Its story does not belong to any previous tradition but it is a new story, and this act of invention by a fifty-year old man, Cervantes, is in itself part of modern literature.

201,"summarize: In this part of the, we turn to the episode of theÂ, which may well be seen as a representation of the political and social landscape in the novel. The episode of Roque Guinizelliâs is discussed with particular emphasis on the characters, who are turned into lapidary figures by submitting their allegiance to the God-endowed sanctity of their city. This element is explored in the famous first sentence of the book, A Primitive Like an Orb, which is a key insight into the nature of literature and human potential. The second half of the lecture turns to a discussion of the â± character of the novel, which becomes a key place in the","summarize: Important meditations about the nature of literature and the real take place in the chapters commented on in this lecture. Reality appears strange enough even to Don Quixote in the episode of the corpse, where death becomes a presence. Don Quixote appears aware that his adventures are being written as we read them. His relationship with his squire is further developed in the episode of the fulling hammers. Mambrinoâs helmet exemplifies the modern radical doubt about the power of the senses to grasp reality, while the episode of the galley slaves represents a satire of autobiographical writing.

The poem Î± presents a view of history that diverges widely from that of the gentry, but it also seems to oppose the idea that all life consists of going and coming back, and this is probably why we approach the end by returning to the beginning. In his last return home, Cervantes reinforces his position that everyone is a reflection of the divine through his encounter with the god Dionysus.","summarize: Professor GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a resumes his commentary on the galley slaves episode by talking about GinÃ©sâ cross-eyedness as a metaphor for congenital internal perspectivism. This is a new model of conflictive being, capable of seeing simultaneously in two ways. The character among the galley slaves that he calls âthe prisoner of sexâ follows.
