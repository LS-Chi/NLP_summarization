0,"Professor lecture deals primarily withÂ Â X, XXI and XXII. The Heaven of the Fixed Stars is situated historically to highlight Danteâs ambivalence towards the world below. The prophetic voice Dante gives in his account of the vision of the siren inÂ Ã¡lez EchevarrÃ­a is read as a description of the inner life of the Trinity, an oblique commentary on the dream of the Siren inÂ VI. The pageant staged here is a meditation on the mediation of God over the failings of earthly creation, exemplified by the pilgrimâ�A who ironically represents the figure of God inÂ V. The end of Virgil (Â XXIV) is also discussed as a contemplation of the divinity of the divine, its relevance to the lives of ordinary people at the time.","Professor Mazzotta continues his discussion of the Heaven of the Sun (Â X-IV), where the earthly disputes between the Franciscan and Dominican orders give way to mutual praise. The tribute St. Thomas pays to the founder of the Franciscan order (Â XI) is repaid by St. Bonaventure through his homage to St. Dominic (Â XII). The chiasmic structure of these cantos is reinforced by the presence of Nathan and Joachim of Flora, the counterweights to Solomon and Siger, among the second ring of sages. Special attention is then paid to the lives St. Francis and St. Dominic presented inÂ Â XI and XII, where the formerâs marriage to Lady Poverty finds its poetic counterpart in the latterâs marriage to theology. The critique of the world and its values shared by these religious founders is explored in light of the âludic theologyâ that pervades these cantos."
1,"Professor this short lecture, Professor Mazzotta introducesÂ Â to Danteâs journey through theÂ. The poetâ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a analyzesÂ , a collection of poetic and political works that conform to Danteian conceptions of divine retributive justice. The idea of wandering is explored in the poem â½, where the pilgrimâ is seen as the first in a line of apostolic (messenger) figures. The encounter of a pilgrim, an ordinary man, in the void of his earthly comforts is read as a contemplation of the sacred.","Professor Mazzotta introduces students to the general scheme and scope of theÂ Â and to the life of its author. Various genres to which the poem belongs (romance, epic, vision) are indicated, and special attention is given to its place within the encyclopedic tradition. The poem is then situated historically through an overview of Danteâs early poetic and political careers and the circumstances that led to his exile. Professor Mazzotta concludes by discussing the central role Danteâs exile was to play in his poetic project."
2,"Professor this lecture, Professor Mazzotta moves from the Heaven of the Moon (Â III) to the Hell of the Fixed Stars (Â IV). The poetâs political maneuvers are explored in light of Danteâ¡lez EchevarrÃ­aâ. The distinction Dante makes between â½ and â²�the latter being an expression of the will and the other being an object of idolatry. The question is raised, however, whether one should be content to retreat into the pit of the earth while the other is contained in the palace. Avellanedaâ s misreading of Cantos I and II leads Dante to probe the boundaries of divine providence by looking beyond the confines of the Roman Empire. By casting Dante as a mediator, Dante shows that the prophetic voice Dante established in his own voice is the voice Dante would later use in the hereafter.","This lecture deals withÂ Â IV, VI and X. At the beginning ofÂ Â IV, the pilgrim raises two questions to which the remainder of the canto is devoted. The first concerns Piccarda (Â III) who was constrained to break her religious vows. The second concerns the arrangement of the souls within the stars. The common thread that emerges from Beatriceâs reply is the relationship between intellect and will. Just as Piccardaâs fate reveals the limitations of the will, the representation of the souls inÂ, a condescension to the pilgrimâs human faculty, as Beatrice explains, reveal the limitations of the intellect. By dramatizing the limitations of both faculties, Dante underscores their interdependence. InÂ Â VI, Dante turns his attention to politics. Through the emperor Justinianâs account of Roman history, Dante places the antithetical views of Virgil and Augustine in conversation. Key to understanding Danteâs position between these two extremes is the vituperation of contemporary civil strife that follows Justinianâs encomium of the Empire"
3,"Professor this lecture, Professor Mazzotta explores Ulyssesâs representation of the Greek world inÂ Â XIX. The poet is positioned as a mediator (in his capacity to bring happiness to the people who are afflicted by his badness) Dante seems to be signaling in his own capacity to elude. InÂ XXVIII, Dante moves from the playful innocence of the ancient world to the more nefarious realm of the Hellenic world, where the shades of shades appear again, united under the auspices of Periclean delights. AvellanÃ­a interprets the scene as a representation of both the classical and modern worlds, setting the stage for the emergence of theÂ. The philosophical journey staged here is an instructive example of the flourishing of poetic mediation in the contemporary world. By contrasting the works of prosopopeia and Ephesus, Dante replaces the mystical tradition of the early Church with that of the Roman Empire.","Professor Mazzotta begins this lecture by recapitulating the ambivalent nature of Ulyssesâ sin and its relevance to Danteâs poetic project.Â Â XXVII is then read in conjunction with the preceding canto. The antithetical relationship between Danteâs false counselors, Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro, anchors an overarching discussion of the relationship between rhetoric and politics. The latter half of the lecture is devoted toÂ Â XXVIII, where Danteâs preeminent sower of discord, Bertran de Born, introduces the principle of theÂ. The law of retribution that governs Danteâs Inferno is discussed in light of classical and contemporary theories of justice/crime and punishment. In conclusion, the opening ofÂ Â XXIX is read as a retrospective gloss on the limitations of retributive justice."
4,"This this lecture, Professor Mazzotta introducesÂ Â I- II and III. The plot of the comedy is then discussed, with Danteâs peculiar choice of a contrasting poetic style from the classical one he had chosen for his journey: the high poetic style ofÂ. The low poetic profanation ofÂ Ã±o staged inÂ XIX warns of the death-dealing power of aesthetics, but the high tragic style of comedy we take for granted here is a satire of its preoccupations with modern notions of divine providence. The fine line between comedy and tragedy is explored in light of the mythological figures ofÂ, such as Medusa and Mulciber, who are said to inhabit the same space as the pilgrim.","Professor Mazzotta introduces students to theÂ, focusing on the first four cantos ofÂ. Stylistic, thematic and formal features of the poem are discussed in the context of its original title,Â. The first canto is read to establish the double voice of the poet-pilgrim and to contrast the immanent journey with those described by Danteâs literary precursors. Among these is the pilgrimâs guide, Virgil. The following cantos are read with special attention to the ways in which Dante positions his poem vis-Ã -vis the classical tradition. The novelty of Danteâs otherworldly journey is here addressed in terms of the relationship, introduced in the previous lecture in the context of theÂ, between love and knowledge or, more precisely, between their respective faculties, will and intellect."
5,"Professor this lecture, Professor Mazzotta discussesÂ Â V, VI, IX and XXI. The ambiguity of the garden inÂ V warns of the dangers of the pilgrimâs encounters with masters of the Italian love lyric. The poetâ�Aristotleâ= lÎ±, a sin punished by the harpies that descend while they wait for divine aid. The encounter between Virgil and St. Bernard in the cantos that follow points to its life-giving potential. The question of what constitutes an originality is explored further in the poem, which deals primarily with the spatial context of the poetics Dante pulls together in his own voice.","This lecture examinesÂ Â IV -VII. Danteâs Limbo, modeled on the classicalÂ, is identified as a place of repose and vulnerability. Here, in fact, among the poets of antiquity, the pilgrim falls prey to poetic hubris by joining in their ranks. The pilgrim is faced with the consequences of his poetic vocation when he descends to the circle of lust (Â V), where Francesca da Rimini, in her failure to distinguishÂ Â from reality, testifies to the dangers inherent to the act of reading. From the destructive power of lust within the private world of the court, Dante moves on to the effects of its sister sin, gluttony, on the public sphere of the city. The relationship posited inÂ Â VI between Ciacco and his native Florence is read as a critique of the âbody politic.â In conclusion, Virgilâs discourse on Fortune in the circle of avarice and prodigality (Â VII) is situated within the Christian world of divine providence."
6,"The Gospel of Mark is a passion narrative with an extended introduction to the ancient reader. Mark is basically a collection of sayings, or logia, that sometimes seem similar, perhaps more primitive than sayings found in the canonical Gospels. Markâs story differs at many points from that of the prophet-martyr, but the author also seems to be a man preaching a Torah observant Christianity. The figure of Jesus in this Jerusalem is Yisrael (570/580/580). Mark is distinguished both for his piety and for his fidelity to the divine.","The Gospels of the New Testament are not biographies, and, in this class, they are read through a historical critical lens. This means that the events they narrate are not taken at face value as historical. The Gospel of Mark illustrates how the gospel writer skillfully crafts a narrative in order to deliver a message. It is a message that emphasizes a suffering messiah, and the necessity of suffering before glory. The gospelâs apocalyptic passages predict troubles for the Jewish temple and incorporate this prediction with its understanding of the future coming of the Son of Man."
7,"The did the New Testament come to an abrupt end in 2 Corinthians? This question, posed in this last lecture, concerned Paulâs attempt to justify his position as bishop. How did this come about? Different strategies, such as the mixing of different religions, were put into practice. In 2 Corinthians Paul is concerned with the problem of reconciling the oppositions of the traditional church and the New Church. TheÂ, however, seems to oppose Pauline teaching.","The Epistle of Jude can be dated to somewhere during post-apostolic Christianity and before the formation of the Canon. It refers to the apostles as representing a prior generation, yet it quotes from texts later excluded (perhaps, for example, by 2 Peter) from the Canon. The letters of Ignatius of Antioch contain evidence of a move toward the institutionalization of early Christianity. It mentions, for example, three different church offices: bishops, presbyters, and deacons. It also heavily emphasizes the authority held by those with these titles. TheÂ Â contains liturgical and ritual instructions for rites such as baptism, the Lordâs Prayer, and the Eucharist. All these documents show the change in early Christianity toward greater church structure and institutionalization."
8,"The Gospel of John is the most important source for understanding the Gospel ofJohn. How did this come to be? Different writers, such as Origen and Origen, discovered ways to read the Gospel in a way that would normally cause a rejection of the materialistsâ position. The Gospel of Daniel also presents a clear example of the difficulties that an early Christianity faced: a man preaching a Torah observant Christianity to the gentiles. However, the Gospel also presents itself paradoxically as preaching a Christian mission to reach gentiles - a mission that seeks to reach Israel.","The Jesus of the Gospel of John often speaks in riddles so that his dialogues with characters such as Nicodemus appear confusing, rather than clarifying. The focus, however, of the Gospel of John is on Christology. In the Gospel, Jesus is divine. So it is also in 1 John, where many of the themes of the Gospel are echoed. 1, 2, and 3 John possibly present us with correspondences of the Johannine community, a sectarian group insisting on the divinity and humanity of Jesus, against the Docetists and other differing forms of early Christianity."
9,"The speech that Stephen gives before his accusers in the New Testament is an attempt to justify the position of âidle-like idolatrousâ½� according to which the author was primarily concerned with depicting the downfall of the Jews. The second half of the lecture turns to Revelation, where the prophet-martyr John is seen as redeemer and liberator in his own Jerusalem.Â Finally, the book of Daniel contains some philosophical musings on the historical traumas of the ancient Near East.","The Apocalypse of John showed an anti-Roman, politically revolutionary perspective. This is in contrast with Paulâs writing in Romans 13, which calls for submission to governmental authorities - although passages in 1 Corinthians may be said to contradict this. 2 Thessalonians, a pseudonymous letter, also preaches a politically conservative and accommodative message, as does 1 Peter. Interestingly, these letters do not discard or ignore apocalypticism but use it quite differently from the author of Revelation to further their message of political conservatism. 2 Peter seems to be a letter dating from the second century, from the post-apostolic age. In 2 Peter, the apocalypse is no longer imminent and is not used to further any admonition. Instead, it has become simply a part of Christian doctrine."
10,"The Christian exegesis of the Hebrews is discussed. The historical critical method of interpreting the Bible is the predominant method of interpretation. Using the Pastoral Epistles and Titus, the professor demonstrates how a historically critical method allows Christians to âtake as many as they would prefer to have.â½� She also presents the New Testament as a collection of sayings that were not included in the original texts, and an account of the rejection of the material world by the Jews as a point of tension. At stake in this discussion is whether or not it is appropriate to read the Bible as a feminist one.","There are many ways of interpreting the text, and ancient methods of interpretation may seem bizarre to our modern sensibilities. The New Testament offers us many examples of how an early Christian might interpret the text of the Hebrew Bible, which was their scripture. The Letter to the Hebrews, which is not really a letter but a speech of encouragement, structures its argument around the thesis that Jesusâ liturgy and priesthood is superior to that in the Hebrew Bible. The author of Hebrews proves this through several interesting interpretations of passages from the Hebrew Bible."
11,"The this lecture, Professor Hayes turns to the chronological end of the Hebrew Bible. The books of the sixth century BCE are structured chronologically by Alexander the Great and Nehemiah. The book of Daniel contains philosophical musings on Godâs behavior (including an account of the downfall of Assyria in the fifth century BCE) and some ambivalence towards the monarchy. At the same time, the books of Jonah and Nehezkel refer to various actions that have been taken against the backdrop of the political turmoil of the period. Finally, the book of Habbakuk is narrated with a view to the historical accuracy of the Deuteronomistic School.","Of the four kingdoms that arose after Alexanderâs death, those of the Seleucids and the Ptolemies are most pertinent to an understanding of the New Testament. Especially important is the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who forced the issue of Hellenism in Jerusalem by profaning the temple. Jews were not alike in their reaction to Hellenization, but a revolt arose under the leadership of the Mattathias and his sons, who would rule in the Hasmonean Dynasty. After the spread of Roman rule, the Judea was under client kings and procurators until the Jewish War and the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. Revolt was only one Jewish response to foreign rule; another was apocalypticism, as we see in Daniel and also in the Jesusâ teaching and the early Christian movement."
12,"The lecture begins with the books of the sixth-century northern prophet Amos (570/580 â565). The book of Job contains three prophecies of destruction and a vision of a new temple and a new covenant that will be inscribed on the hearts of the nation. The second half of the lecture turns to the book of Ecclesiastes (565) where the wicked Assyrians repent and are spared divine punishment. The book concludes with the story of the wanderings of Odysseus, a pagan suicide who is believed to have profited from the sin of immorality. The third half of this lecture looks at the dynamic messages presented in Ezra and Nehemiah: God is compassionate and concerned with all creation.","The destruction of Jerusalem challenged the faith of the nation. What was the meaning of this event and how could such tremendous evil and suffering be reconciled with the nature of God himself? Professor Hayes shows how Israelâs prophets attempted to answer this question, turning the nationâs defeat and despair into an occasion for renewing faith in Israelâs God. The lecture continues with an in-depth study of the book of Ezekiel. Ezekielâs denunciations of Jerusalem are among the most lurid and violent in the Bible and he concludes that destruction is the only possible remedy. Ezekielâs visions include Godâs withdrawal from Jerusalem to be with his people in exile, and his ultimate return. Ezekielâs use of dramatic prophetic signs, his rejection of collective divine punishment and assertion of individual responsibility are discussed. The last part of the lecture turns to Second Isaiah and the famous âservant songsâ that find a universal significance in Israelâs suffering."
13,"The lecture focuses on the Deuteronomistic historian, Mohammed Bin Jowett. An interpretation of the book of 2 Kings is offered as an alternative interpretation of what happened to the Israelite religion in the last period. The Deutonomist argues that the books of 1 and 2 Kings provide a good example of exemplary political and intellectual activity. However, the book also presents a history of extreme forms of idolatry, including an account of the downfall of Assyria in the 622s and a book of Psalms describing the wanderings of Nimrod (570/580). The book of Chronicles concludes with the story of the pilgrimâs journey through the desert, setting the stage for the Exodus in which God is seen as redeemer and liberator.",This lecture concludes the discussion of the Deuteronomistic historianâs efforts to show that idolatry and associated sins lead to Godâs wrath and periods of trouble. The remainder of the lecture is an introduction to the phenomenon of Israelite prophecy which included ecstatic prophecy and prophetic guilds. The non-literary prophets of the historical books of the Bible and their various roles (as Godâs zealot; as conscience of the king) are examined.
14,"Thisah, the third book of the Bible, documents the emergence of Israel from Egypt in the fifth century. The books of the Deuteronomistic School are structured chronologically to outline Godâs covenant with the Israelites and their obligations under the covenantal stipulations. This covenant is then revisited in the book of Exodus, where God is seen as redeemer (or liberator) and liberator (ator) in the story of Exodus. Exodus concludes with Mosesâ�Aristotle commenting on his account of the reversal of earthly status.Palestine, in the Time of Saul, is said to have been a case study of the exiles, but also a site of religious conversion. Exodus ends with an eschatology according to which God dramatically intervenes in the lives of the ancient Israelites.","This lecture introduces biblical law in a comparative approach that identifies similarities and differences between Israelite law and other Ancient Near Eastern legal traditions, such as the Code of Hammurabi. Distinctive features of Israelite law are explained as flowing from the claim of divine authorship."
15,"The this lecture, Mosesâs final address to the Israelites is read as a rebuke to the wickedness of God. The book of Exodus contains some of the best passages in which Moses is seen as redeemer (the prophet-martyr) and liberator (the adulterous wife). The book concludes with the story of the wanderings of the Nile, an episode in which God dramatically intervenes in the lives of the righteous (including Yahweh). Finally, the book of Daniel contains some Psalms that exemplify the ancient Near Eastern literary genre of exile: themes in classical Greek and Christian literature.","This lecture traces the account of the Exodus (and the origin of the Passover festival as a historicization of older nature festivals) and Israelâs liberation from bondage under Pharaoh. The story reaches its climax with the covenant concluded between God and Israel through Moses at Sinai. Drawing heavily on the work of Jon Levenson, the lecture examines Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the Sinaitic covenant and describes the divine-human relationship (an intersection of law and love) that the covenant seeks to express."
16,"The this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the creation of new stories in the context of Genesis 3. The first half of the lecture turns to the story of Enkidu (âs journey through Egypt), an archetypical God-like creation account that seems somewhat similar to the book of Genesis; it is full of long dialogues and full of complex moral dilemmas. In the second part of the discussion, the author draws a contrast between himself and the other characters in the book: the wandering hidalgo who is seen to have profited unfairly while the rest of the book is written as if it were a fiction. Finally, the third section of the course turns to a discussion of the biblical parallels between God and Satan: the third and fourth books of the Bible are also discussed with attention paid to their historical parallels.","This lecture continues the discussion on Genesis, including the familiar accounts of Cain and Abel, the Flood and Noahide covenant. The story of Cain and Abel expresses the notion of the God-endowed sanctity of human life and a âuniversal moral lawâ governing the world. Examination of the contradictions and doublets in the flood story leads to a discussion of the complex composition and authorship of the Pentateuch. These features as well as anachronisms challenge traditional religious convictions of Moses as the author of the first five books of the Bible."
17,"Professor Martin Luther Kingâs assassination in the April of 1968, the Montgomery bus boycott, the desegregation of Central High School, and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party are discussed. The militancy seen in these images is not limited to the black militants; the militancy witnessed the largest mobilization of African Americans in any single protest. In the second portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway canvasses some key moments of the civil rights movement, including the formation of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969, the 1964 march from Selma to Montgomery, the signing of the 1965 Civil Rights Act, the riots that summer in South Central, as well as the National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana in the late 1980s. As the movement grew beyond its traditional boundaries, it became clear that people were prepared to enlarge the struggle so that it became linked to larger issues including urban life, racial violence, ecological change, economic despair, and urban decay.","Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement have become embodied in each other. But in this lecture, Professor Holloway asks: what of the other activists in the struggle? What of the other organizations involved in the struggle? And what of the history of the struggle before King reluctantly emerged on the scene? By uncovering the histories of the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, the death of Emmett Till, the Greensboro student sit-ins, and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one finds differing responses to violence and multiple approaches to attacking racial bias and discrimination. Professor Holloway also draws attention to the gender dynamics of the civil rights movement by considering the inner-workings of the Womenâs Political Council in Montgomery, Alabama, the original motivating force behind the 1955 bus boycott, and the great importance of respectability to the movement. This lecture reveals that there was no single civil rights movement, that there were many activists working in a variety of different ways and with varying degrees of success, and that King was a complicated figure, both inspiring and stifling activism."
18,"Professor this final lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the post-civil rights movement, looking at the complicated messages about race in the 1990s and 2000s. He focuses on the notion that the quickest way to improve the quality of oneâs political life is to forge a peace with the views of black Americans. He then examines the emerging politicization of the image of the â½ white male candidate, John C. Fremont, in the advertisement for the Willie Horton ad. In the second half of the lecture, he focuses on Barack Obamaâ�A. Reaganâd election; his 2008 inauguration; and his speech, Ïas a guest lecture by Latasha Harlins. An early look at the fractured racial discourse of the 1980s reveals how the media reinforced the stereotype of Ï±, the same way we have been able to improve our political perception of the sixties.","In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses how race influenced public policy by examining some of the key cultural symbols of the past few decades, all in an effort to answer the question: how is race used in our society? Professor Holloway discusses Bill Clintonâs policies in particular, honing in on his ability to connect with the African American community, the controversy surrounding Lani Guinierâs cabinet appointment, and his National Dialogue on Race. He then turns to California to examine the passage of Propositions 187 and 209, which begin to call into question common notions about civil rights legislation and affirmative action in our nation. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway talks about four landmark court casesâ,,, and âto shed light on the way race began to operate in a legal setting, as well as the general dumbing down of discourse in politics and media about race, in the post-civil rights era."
19,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway explores the complicated texture of the African Renaissance. Different narratives are discussed, including an exploration of the nature of the black race and what it means to be âpostmodern.â½� The figure of Marcus Garvey is considered as the mediator of the political movement; his role as spokesman for the New Black Panther Party; and his engagement with the cultural milieu of the 1960s. In the second half of the lecture, he looks at the shifting racial landscape of the early part of the century, looking at the rise of anti-modernism in the 1920s and 1930s. He also moves from the ideas of uplift and respectability to the racial and ethnic milieu we take for granted today. As a case study, he shows how the rhetoric of the Harlem Renaissance reinforces and pushes beyond the boundaries of the neo-New Black Panther regime.","The Harlem Renaissance brought together legions of black writers, artists, musicians, and intellectuals who celebrated black culture and romanticized its connections to an African past. In this lecture, Professor Holloway documents some of the expressions of the Harlem Renaissance (also known as the New Negro Renaissance), the political and cultural movement that claimed Harlem as its figurative capital. In fact, thousands of African Americans flocked to Harlem, and it became the center of a rich cultural and political environmentâone always fraught with complications, but still understood to represent the best that black America had to offer. As Professor Holloway shows, white enthusiasts of these newly-admired cultural forms visited Harlem to get a taste of black life. Indeed, without the financial support of the white community, whatever cultural efflorescence that did exist in Harlem would have been significantly less grand. Yet the tensions between white patrons and black artists, as well as between black intellectuals and black artists, made the Harlem Renaissance a complex movement."
20,"The this lecture, Professor Holloway offers a richer portrait of black America than the ân Negroesâ½� who were created in the wake of World War I. The New Negroes were not treated as demigods; rather, they were used as social proxies for the invaders. In the second portion of the lecture, Garvey focuses on the relationship between race and national identity. An important point in the discussion is the linkage between the racial dichotomy we encountered at the end of the 1800s, with the violence of lynchings and deportations echoing the new mentality of the New Negro people. As the Cold War marched on, more and more Americans would be lynched; the war progressed; charges of communism would decimate some African Americans; the possibility of an uprising would occur.","In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the New Negro mentality, a new black consciousness forged out of political and economic frustration and the cultural shocks of the Great Migration. The New Negro ideology was articulated on a wide scale after World War I, when the promises of democracy at home went unfulfilled. Marcus Garvey best articulated this new consciousness through his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the first organized grassroots mass protest movement in African American history. Garvey advocated black pride and autonomy, worked to build a great steam line so blacks could partake in nation-building, and helped dispirited blacks dream of an eventual return to Africa. Garveyâs ability to realize his dreams was limited by his own organizational ineptitude and by the federal governmentâs systematic attempts to infiltrate and then destroy the UNIA. The lecture ends with an examination of Garveyâs relationships to other black leaders, including Father Divine and his Peace Mission Movement."
21,"Professor Blight finishes his discussion of Reconstruction by describing the political strategy of the early part of 1865. The central figure in this phase was President Andrew Johnson. Under Johnsonâs stewardship, southern whites held constitutional conventions throughout 1865 to try to get their rights recognized as something legitimate and just. Even after the passage of the 15th Amendment in 1863, Congressional Republicans were concerned that the new radical factions would complicate the process of emancipation. In 1868, Congressional Radicals introduced two vital pieces of Reconstruction legislation - the 13th Amendment and the FreedmanâS Bill. The Congressional elections in 1868 saw the official passage of four Reconstruction Acts, the first of which outlawed slavery. The second half of the lecture focuses on the fractured nature of Reconstruction, with the rhetoric of the Congressional Black Caucus and the House of Representatives discussing how these events encouraged northerners to tire of the Reconstruction experiment.","Between 1865 and 1877, several plans were developed by which the Confederate states could be readmitted to the Union and the residents of the states given full citizenship rights. It was far from clear, however, which plan would do a better job maintaining the social peace and protecting African Americansâ ability to earn a wage, raise a family, own land, and exercise the right to vote. In this lecture, Professor Holloway outlines the contours of the Ten Percent Plan, Presidential Reconstruction, and Radical Reconstruction, and he explains how these plans embraced a variety of approaches to reuniting the disparate states. As Professor Holloway explains, Reconstruction greatly enhanced the rights of African Americans, while also circumscribing their lives by new political, economic, and social initiatives."
22,"Professor Blight finishes his discussion of the Civil War by describing the complicated meaning of the word â freedom. The slave society in the South was dominated by unscrupulous and criminal Yankees who relied on the ignorant black vote to rob and despoil innocent Americans. The nature of the slave society is then discussed, with particular attention paid to Frederick Douglassâ½âs assertion that the only good way for blacks to be respected and valued is through the use of propaganda. Douglass also highlights the importance of historical lessons for African Americans, including the experiences of women in the military during the war.","In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a brief summary of what was happening in the decades leading up to the Civil War, including the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scott decision, and John Brownâs raid at Harpers Ferry. He discusses the Civil War, focusing specifically on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Conscription Acts of 1863. Professor Holloway spends the duration of the lecture focusing on the labor and racial tensions that led to the New York City draft riots and their aftermath. The crucible of the Civil War, he argues, gives a very clear picture of what it means to be a citizen and what it means to be American. Professor Holloway then gives specific examples of how citizenship was linked to freedom, how freedom was linked to race, and how the tensions between these linkages produced extreme violence."
23,"Class begins with a review of the problems previously addressed about dark matter and dark energy in the universe. The nature of dark matter is then discussed, with an emphasis on how clustering occurs in the form of supernovae. The discovery of dark energy is revisited and the universe is introduced as a model of the expansion of the universe to fill in the void that was previously occupied by dark energy. The lecture then turns to a discussion of New York Cityâs famous redshift diagram, which uses statistical analysis to show that the entire universe is comprised of compact particles. The difficulty of measuring distance from the ground is then addressed. Measurements of the brightness of high redshift anomalies are used to help astronomers identify new features in the quasars and dark matter. Finally, Professor Bailyn offers a way of understanding the origins, evolution, and boundaries of the Big Rip.","In this third of three update lectures, Prof. Bailyn provides new information pertaining to the third part of the course, on cosmology. The basic model of the Universe, including Dark Matter and Dark Energy, is supported by all recent evidence. Work is thus beginning on sorting out the consequences of this model, in particular the growth of structure in the Universe, from tiny modulations of the Cosmic Microwave Background to the current distribution of galaxies."
24,"The discussion of black holes continues. A second update is introduced to the first half of the course, focusing on black holes in the context of an event horizon. In this context, we are able to locate black holes because we can calculate the spin of a black hole over time. The actual size of the black hole is discussed and compared. Finally, Professor Bailyn introduces the concepts of gravitational lensing and dark matter. The lecture ends with a question-and-answer session during which students inquire about how astronomers find black holes.","In this second of three update lectures, Prof. Bailyn discusses new information pertaining to the second part of the course, on black holes. In this lecture Prof. Bailyn describes recent work by he and his colleagues on determining the spin of black holes, which is the only parameter of consequence other than the mass. The results of these investigations are currently ambiguous and controversial."
25,"Theoplanets are introduced and students learn how to detect their presence as well as the challenges associated with it. Physics equations are also discussed in the context of the climate change crisis. A number of problems are worked out to get students used to dealing with large numbers in calculating planetary masses, interplanetary distances, etc.Professor Bailynâs guide to Astronomy","Professor Bailyn introduces the course and discusses the course material and requirements. The three major topics that the course will cover are (1) exoplanetsâplanets around stars other than the Sun, (2) black holesâstars whose gravitational pull is so strong that even their own light rays cannot escape, and (3) cosmologyâthe study of the Universe as a whole. Class proper begins with a discussion on planetary orbits. A brief history of astronomy is also given and its major contributors over the centuries are introduced: Ptolemy, Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton.Professor Bailynâs guide to Extrasolar Planet Websites"
26,The begins with a review of the Schwarzschild radius and density. The concept of mass is introduced along with the imaginary number of objects in this space. The mass of an object is shown to be invariant (the same for all observers). The metric is revisited to see how the concepts of mass and radius are related to one another. The lecture ends with problems of reconciling Newtonâs laws of gravity.,"Class begins with clarification of equations from the previous lecture. Four post-Newtonian gravitational effects are introduced and discussed in detail. The first of these is the so-called Perihelion Precession, which occurs when the major axis of a planetâs elliptical orbit precesses within its orbital plane, in response to changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. Secondly, deflection of light is described as the curving of light as it passes near a large mass. Gravitational redshift is explained as a frequency effect that occurs as light moves away from a massive body such as a star or black hole. Finally, the existence and effects of gravitational waves are discussed. The lecture closes with a brief history of the 1919 eclipse expedition that made Einstein famous."
27,"The is the first of a series of lectures on problem sets. Problems are introduced and solved to explore various aspects of the Earthâs climate system. A discussion follows about how such problems relate to our climate. The second half of the lecture looks at Neptuneâ�Aristotle, the demotion of Pluto from an ordinary eyeball to an immaterial object in the sky. The discovery of Neptune is revisited and the philosophical debates over it are expounded. Finally, Professor Bailyn discusses the possibility of an intelligent person as a motivator for political action.","Class begins with a review of the first problem set. Newtonâs Third Law is applied in explaining how exoplanets are found. An overview of the Solar System is given; each planet is presented individually and its special features are highlighted. Astronomy is discussed as an observational science, and the subject of how to categorize objects in the Solar System is addressed. The Pluto controversy is given special attention and both sides of the argument regarding its status are considered."
28,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines the developments that took place after the Peloponnesian victory over the Athenians. He argues that the decision to go into war was one of the most difficult decisions of the Greek world. In addition, he shows how Pericles can create an alliance that is both defensive and diplomatic in ways that would not be successful in defeating the Spartans. Finally, he comments on the Athenian practice of ostracism as a political tool to deter the Spartans from quitting the war.","In this lecture, Professor Kagan focuses on the causes of the Peloponnesian War and the possible motivations for Thucydidesâ book,Â. Concerning the first point, Professor Kagan parts ways with Thucydides and argues that the war was not inevitable and that the Athenians under Pericles followed a policy of deterrence, which was aimed at peace. Similarly, he points out that there were a number of Spartans who did not want war as well. Therefore, according to this line of reasoning, war broke out due to a number of factors that were avoidable. Concerning the second point, Professor Kagan argues that Thucydides was a revisionist historian. In other words, Thucydides was writing not as a disinterested historian, but as a historian with a point to make, namely, that the war was inevitable and that Athens was only a democracy in name under Pericles. Finally, Professor Kagan acknowledges that his two points are debatable."
29,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the history of the ancient Greeks. He argues that in many ways, the structure of government is similar to that of the Roman Empire: it provides an example of a âmonarchical republicâ½�; it operates in opposition to the domination of the aristocracy; and it deals with abuses of power. Finally, Professor Kagan intimates that the rise of the hoplite farmer was accompanied by an attempt to impose an idea of self-government on the Greek people.","Professor Donald Kagan explains why people should study the ancient Greeks. He argues that the Greeks are worthy of our study not only because of their vast achievements and contributions to Western civilization (such as in the fields of science, law, and politics) but also because they offer a unique perspective on humanity. To the Greeks, man was both simultaneously capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes; he was both great and important, but also mortal and fallible. He was a tragic figure, powerful but limited. Therefore, by studying the Greeks, one gains insight into a tension that has gripped and shaped the West and the rest of the world through its influence. In short, to study the Greeks is to study the nature of human experience."
30,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines the developments of the Greek world. He argues that the development of new colonies led to the emergence of new ones: the Athenians and the Thasians. In addition, he shows how this came about. The Athenians were able to seize a large area on the coast of Messenia and establish an army roughly equivalent to the one they had established in the Delian League. Finally, Professor Gendler discusses the rise of Athenian naval power. She ends by describing the Athenian victories at Phyle and Corinth.","In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the mechanics of the Delian League and its transformation into the Athenian empire. This transformation caused Athens to rival Sparta as an equal in power and prestige. He also argues that this process took place rather smoothly due to the good relations between Sparta and Athens. Professor Kagan argues that Cimon the Athenian generally played an important part in this development. Finally, Professor Kagan begins to describe the workings of Athenian democracy by comparing it with modern American democracy."
31,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan discusses the developments of Sparta. He argues that in many ways, the constitution of the assembly was the first step in the development of the Spartan constitution. In addition, he shows how the King was able to create an army comprised of all the adult male Spartan citizens. Finally, Professor Kagan comments on the differences between the northern and southern hemispheres. On the one hand, the fighting men lead the charge against the Spartans; on the other hand, they are afraid of the Spartansâ aggressive behavior. At the meeting of the Athenian assembly, the tensions between the various sides were then resolved. The king decides on a defensive alliance.","In this lecture, Professor Kagan finishes up his description of the Spartan constitution. He argues that Sparta had a mixed constitution and gained great power due to alliances that the Spartans made with their neighbors. After the discussion of Sparta, Professor Kagan examines Athens and the development of the Athenian constitution. In addition, he shows how different these twoÂ were. Finally, Professor Kagan discusses the emergence of the hoplite class in Athens and the failure of Cylon to make himself tyrant of Athens."
32,"The nineteenth century is, in some ways, synonymous with the golden age of Nietzsche, Freud, and Weber. The tension between Marxâs notion of alienation and exploitation is not reconciled in terms of his emphasis on â½�power and consciousness.âthe argument is then drawn between Nietzsche and Freud for their opposition to the dominant modes of authority. In the second half of the lecture, we discuss the Frankfurt School, a philosophical movement founded upon an idea of justice in the context of the Enlightenment.","Today we take a bridge into the twentieth century, constructed by Nietzsche, Freud, and Weberâs critical theory. Each author is different in important ways, but they also agree on two crucial points: we must subject our consciousness and assumptions to critical scrutiny and, along with increasing liberation and rationalization in some ways, modern society also has repressive elements. Nietzsche is the oldest of these thinkers; he dies in 1900 and stops working a decade before due to mental illness. While he was ill, his sister, a proto-Nazi and associate of Hitler, cared for him. Her control of his papers and how they were released to the public painted him as a proto-Nazi himself, but reading his whole oeuvre illuminates that Nietzsche subjected Judaism and Christianity to the same scrutiny. In, Nietzsche attempts to use the genealogy method to be critical of modern morality without taking a certain vantage point. We discuss most specifically his genealogy of the ideas of good and bad and of good and evil."
33,"The Sigmund Freud wrote his best-known work after he recovered from a period of serious mental illness near the turn of the 19th century. The idea of good is not intrinsically bad; in contrast, the deontological conception of goodness is more ambiguous. Freudâs theory of â½�veilââââ�ETRY,â±) that is, the lowest point. This distinction is then drawn between Marx and Nietzsche who both positivistic and liberal conceptions of the good. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Gendler turns to a discussion of the Frankfurt School. The theoretical writings of Paul Fry and John Stuart Mill are explored in light of their historical and political contexts. The lecture concludes with an exploration of the philosophical claims of Ï, including an emphasis on the loss of moral distinctions for the sake of Î±.","Freudâs brand of critical theory adds important dimensions; he argues that we can better understand our consciousness through the process of psychoanalysisâthe talking cure, dream work, etcâand we can cure ourselves through this process as well. We discuss Freudâs early days in Vienna developing psychoanalysis as a clinical approach alongside Jung, Ferenczi, and others in their tight-knit circle. They develop the ideas of the id, ego, and superego as well as the antithetical drives, the love drive (Eros) and the death drive (Thanatos). Later, Freud applies these concepts to society as a whole in his books, and. His argument in Â calls to mind Nietzsche; he argues that the repression of urges and drives allows civilization to bloom and flourish, but the same repression is problematic on the level of individual psychology as well as on the level of civilization."
34,"Marx discussion of Marxâs theory of history continues but this time, the focus is on the young Marx who, in his mind, is at the center of a discussion about the transition from Hegelian idealism to a more mature Marx who is interested in the causes of the transition. Marx argues that the process by which we learn about our real individual and our real social condition is what drives us to change the world. He goes on to explore the Frankfurt School, arguing that the German conquest of the French lands was not an inevitable step in the development of the capitalist system. The lecture ends with a brief discussion of the historical fluctuations of the Revolution, as we see it in the writings of Max Weber and Robert Nozick.","We consider closely Marxâs, written between Â andÂ. In theÂ, Marx revisits and revises his theory of historical change. Previously, he argued that history is characterized by a uni-linear increase in the division of labor. He also argued that class struggle caused revolutionary transitions from one mode of production to the nextâslavery to feudalism to capitalismâand that Communism will be the last stage in social evolution. In theÂ, Marx develops a theory of historical change focused on property relations. In addition, he depicts a more complex, multi-linear development of history. The facet of Marx which he exhibits in theÂ Â tends not to be the one that is widely remembered, but understanding the nuances he presents there is crucial to fully understand his idea of history and historical change and the role of property in capitalism and Communism."
35,"The discussion of suicide continues. A number of methodological innovations are attempted to determine the circumstances under which a person chooses to make a decision about continuing or ending life. Among these is Durkheimâs definition of suicide as an ongoing process and one for which there is solid documentary evidence. The rest of the lecture focuses on the social context, particularly with regard to the nature of the individual committing suicide. An important question is whether it is appropriate to consider a voluntary act of suicide, as compared to other stigmatizing actions taken by those committing it. Finally, Professor Gendler considers a number of unresolved problems in the context of suicide.","DurkheimâsÂ Â is a foundational text for the discipline of sociology, and, over a hundred years later, it remains influential in the study of suicide. Durkheimâs study demonstrates that what is thought to be a highly individual act is actually socially patterned and has social, not only psychological, causes. Durkheimâs study uses the logic of multivariate statistical analysis, which is now widely used in the discipline of sociology. Durkheim considered factors including country, marital status, religion, and education level to explain variations in suicide rates. Durkheim found that Protestants, who tended to be more highly educated, had a higher rate of suicide than Catholics, who tended to have lower levels of education. Jewish people fell outside of this pattern; highly educated, they had a very low rate of suicide. Durkheim explained that the education of Protestants led them to individual consciousness whereas the education of Jewish people meant to make them more integrated into their religious community. Durkheim arrives at a typology of suicide ranging between high and low regulation and high and low integration: egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic suicide."
36,"Theiverging significantly from Marxâs idea that the working classes are the â½ of the earth, Weber argues that the emergence of the class is an indicator of the capitalist mode of production. He goes on to discuss the different modes of production, from the notion of the efficient use of resources to the notion and the relation between labor and capitalism. He focuses his attention on the ideas of equality for the poor, the inclusiveness of the market, and the distinction between property and capital. He ends by suggesting that the capitalist system forces people into one of two classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. This dichotomy does not describe accurately representative of the economic realities of capitalism. We will look at some examples of the different types of labor, defined as either the bourgeoisie or the proletariat, respectively.","Along with the macro-level shift from traditional forms of authority to legal-rational authority, Weberâs theory of class identifies a macro-level shift from status to class determining life chances. In feudal times, under traditional forms of authority, monarchs or others in power conferred high status upon individuals and material wealth followed; first a man would be named a nobleman, and then he would get his estate. In the modern capitalist era, individuals obtain their monetary or material wealth and their class position vis-Ã -vis the market determines their life chances. Weber, in contrast to Marx, argues that class is a modern phenomenon. However, this does not mean that our modern and contemporary world does not have versions of status. Like remnants of traditional and charismatic authority co-mingled with legal-rational authority in the state and other institutions, status still determines life chances to a certain extent. The influence of status is somewhat subsumed under Weberâs category of social class."
37,"We rational authority is the purest type of legal-rational authority, and can be established in cooperation with various levels of government. The primary objection raised to this approach is the notion of âjust laws,â a kind of authority that is not regulated by regulation. In order to legitimate the claim that just laws are not justified by their conclusions, we must consider the different forms of authority: democracy, justice, and the environment. We consider the cases of Germany after World War I, in which the civil servants were not treated as prisoners of war. Finally, we consider the case of Bolivia after the collapse of apartheid in the 1970s.","The purest formâthe ideal typeâof Weberâs legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens or clients alike."
38,"The discussion of exponents continues but this time the focus is on the Boltzmann factor. The notion of âthe chairâ½� is discussed. Boltzmanâszentmihalyiâ�s definition of the chair is introduced. Measuring the weight of a fluid overlying a particular area is used to illustrate the importance of estimating the entropy change for a number of different processes. Finally, several specific exponents are introduced: cyclohexane, Epidamnus, and Clustering. These structures are described in detail to show that the uncertainty principle arises from the fact that space and time change as we move along a particular set of parameters.","After discussing the statistical basis of the law of mass action, the lecture turns to developing a framework for understanding reaction rates. A potential energy surface that associates energy with polyatomic geometry can be realized physically for a linear, triatomic system, but it is more practical to use collective energies for starting material, transition state, and product, together with Eyring theory, to predict rates. Free-radical chain halogenation provides examples of predicting reaction equilibria and rates from bond dissociation energies. The lecture concludes with a summary of the semesterâs topics from the perspective of physical-organic chemistry.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
39,Professor lecture continues the discussion of molecular orbitalals by focusing on the atomic orbitals of ammonia and methanol. The molecular orbital of an atom is used to illustrate how a low electron density affects the kinetic energy of a moleculeâs atoms. Molecular orbitalals are divided into singly-occupied nodes (two nodes each) and two half-lives (two). A combination of buoyancy forces and the influence of ion channels on formation of molecules in the gas phase is shown to influence the rate of formation of new bonds.Professor McBrideâ¡s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008),"This lecture begins by applying the united-atom âplum-puddingâ view of molecular orbitals, introduced in the previous lecture, to more complex molecules. It then introduces the more utilitarian concept of localized pairwise bonding between atoms. Formulating an atom-pair molecular orbital as the sum of atomic orbitals creates an electron difference density through the cross product that enters upon squaring a sum. This âoverlapâ term is the key to bonding. The hydrogen molecule is used to illustrate how close a simple sum of atomic orbitals comes to matching reality, especially when the atomic orbitals are allowed to hybridize.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
40,"Professor can look at legal considerations regarding stereochemistry by looking at the U.S. Navyâs decision not to allow a trial of a single enantiomer in 2009. Professor Wargo talks about how the FDA protects citizens from toxics, and highlights its own uses of the term, including those in which the enantiomers are involved. He then moves on to discussions of legal considerations in the context of anti-Markovnikov regiospecificity. The FDA has used warnings and control over advertising for pharmaceuticals, such as Chinese government initiatives to combat the epidemic of Liptis, an important step in the biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals. He concludes by signaling the future direction of scientific exploration.","After mentioning some legal implications of chirality, the discussion of configuration concludes using esomeprazole as an example of three general methods for producing single enantiomers. Conformational isomerism is more subtle because isomers differ only by rotation about single bonds, which requires careful physico-chemical consideration of energies and their relation to equilibrium and rate constants. Conformations have their own notation and nomenclature. Curiously, the barrier to rotation about the C-C bond of ethane was established by measuring its heat capacity.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
41,Theomerism is not an essential form of scientific knowledge; vanât Hoff was the first in a line of chemists who discovered solvents and alkanes that appeared to be non-atomic. The second half of the lecture introduces molecular mechanics to the study of the arrangement of atoms in molecules by looking at two graphs in one dimension: lactic acid and hydracrylic acid. A mathematical explanation is given for how such information arrived at the University of Adelaide.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008),"With his tetrahedral carbon models vanât Hoff explained the mysteries of known optical isomers possessing stereogenic centers and predicted the existence of chiral allenes, a class of molecules that would not be observed for another sixty-one years. Symmetry operations that involve inverting an odd number of coordinate axes interconvert mirror-images. Like printed words, only a small fraction of molecules are achiral. Verbal and pictorial notation for stereochemistry are discussed.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
42,"The dynamics of molecules is discussed in greater detail. In the one-dimensional realm there is a higher density of gases and ions than there is in the 3-dimensional world. The energy stored in the gas tank is mixed up with the kinetic energy received by the particle in the air. Properties of gases are quantified and the concentration of water in the ocean is revisited. Finally, several problems are solved to demonstrate how to calculate the entropy change in an ideal atom.","After showing how a double-minimum potential generates one-dimensional bonding, Professor McBride moves on to multi-dimensional wave functions. Solving SchrÃ¶dingerâs three-dimensional differential equation might have been daunting, but it was not, because the necessary formulas had been worked out more than a century earlier in connection with acoustics. Acoustical âChladniâ figures show how nodal patterns relate to frequencies. The analogy is pursued by studying the form of wave functions for âhydrogen-likeâ one-electron atoms. Removing normalizing constants from the formulas for familiar orbitals reveals the underlying simplicity of their shapes.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
43,"Theoisierâs book,, describes the development of organic nomenclature in the eighteenth century. The first half of the lecture talks about how Lavoisier developed a strictly logical system for analyzing molecules, such as nitrous oxides and silyl ethers. Three different types of oxidation are discussed: primary, secondary, and tertiary. A discussion follows about the use of diagrams in describing chemical reactions in terms of the mixing of charged particles in organic chemistry: both quantitative and qualitative; and an examination of the relationship between molecular structure and nomenciation. Lavoisiersâ�Auerbachâs de Manardt, a French scholar in Paris since the nineteenth century, argued that the special acidity of water was crucial in understanding organic chemistry.Professor McBrideâ�An introduction to CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","This lecture traces the development of elemental analysis as a technique for the determination of the composition of organic compounds beginning with Lavoisierâs early combustion and fermentation experiments, which showed a new, if naÃ¯ve, attitude toward handling experimental data. Daltonâs atomic theory was consistent with the empirical laws of definite, equivalent, and multiple proportions. The basis of our current notation and of precise analysis was established by Berzelius, but confusion about atomic weight multiples, which could have been clarified early by the law of Avogadro and Gay-Lussac, would persist for more than half a century.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
44,"The McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008) explore several cases in which molecular mechanics is used to measure the energy of molecules. Complex numbers are used to convert differential equations to algebraic equations. The lecture explores the relationships among molecular structures, and their properties. It ends with a question-and-answer session during which students inquire about how chemists might be able to find the determinants of molecular structure in abstract terms.Daniel van der Waals radii analyzes kinetic isotope signatures in viscous solvents that are dissimilar to those encountered in X-ray studies.Professor McBride also introduces a concept of disorder in light of previous work by BÃ¼rgi and Dunitz, who claimed to discover the presence of an immaterial entity in a fluid state. Professor McBride then discusses the possibility of homologation in terms of conformational and configurational space.","Although molecular mechanics is imperfect, it is useful for discussing molecular structure and energy in terms of standard covalent bonds. Analysis of the Cambridge Structural Database shows that predicting bond distances to within 1% required detailed categorization of bond types. Early attempts to predict heats of combustion in terms of composition proved adequate for physiology, but not for chemistry. Group- or bond-additivity schemes are useful for understanding heats of formation, especially when corrected for strain. Heat of atomization is the natural target for bond energy schemes, but experimental measurement requires spectroscopic determination of the heat of atomization of elements in their standard states.Professor McBrideâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)"
45,"Professorugation makes a difference in the allyl system, but it is only in the context of molecular rotation. Boronâs web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008) explore conjugation in three functional groups: an allylic intermediates, a tetrahedral intermediate, and a free-radical intermediate. Conformational energy is then averaged over a number of molecules in the same space. Averaging of the data reveals that the dissociation of ions from the ocean is prohibitively expensive. The use of enols to measure net optical rotation is shown to involve a highly coordinated application of molecular mechanics.Professor McBrideâ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a comments on the fine differences between rhetoric and reality before moving on to quantum mechanics.","Despite the substantial change in the energy of individual orbitals, the overall pi-electron energy and orbital shape changes little upon linear conjugation of two double bonds. Conjugation energy of polyenes and allylic systems may be predicted by means of a semicircle mnemonic. The much greater stabilization in âaromaticâ conjugated rings, and HÃ¼ckelâs 4n+2 rule, derive from alternating stabilization and destabilization of successive orbitals when the ends of a conjugated chain overlap as it is closed to form a ring. A circle mnemonic predicts orbital energies for conjugated rings. This aromaticity concept is generalized to heteroaromatic compounds like furan and imidazole, to polycyclic compounds like naphthalene, and to hydrocarbon ions like cyclopentadienide.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
46,"Re organic molecules that are unusually stable have a higher probability of being so stable than is the case with phenyl-substituted alkanes. A typical analysis of these reliable data reveals only one significant negative side effects: hydrogen peroxide, enols, and cation rearrangement. The second half of the lecture introduces molecular mechanics to the study of the stability of aromaticity by analyzing the orbitals of singly-occupied molecular nodes (SOMOs) in an âopticalâ½� ring. Characteristic characteristics of such reactions are illustrated using Couette flow. Entropy favors ascetic or hydride substitution over elimination of acyl-aromatic eliminations.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","Cyclic conjugation that arises when -orbitals touch one another can be as important for transition states as aromaticity is for stable molecules. It is the controlling factor in âpericyclicâ reactions. Regiochemistry, stereochemistry, and kinetics show that two new sigma bonds are being formed simultaneously, if not symmetrically, in the 6-electron Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Although thermal dimerization of thymine residues in DNA is forbidden, photochemistry allows the 4-electron cycloaddition. âElectrocyclicâ ring opening or closing chooses a conrotatory MÃ¶bius pathway, or a disrotatory HÃ¼ckel pathway, according to the number of electron pairs involved and whether light is used in the process. Dewar benzene provides an example of a very unstable molecule that can be formed photochemically and then persists because of unfavorable orbital overlap in the transition state for ring opening.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
47,"The dissociation of water from the water phase in the gas phase is important because ions dissociate from one another and cannot be interconverted by an unsymmetrical 3-center-2-electron orbitals. The dissociation energies of water into ions are then divided into two groups: H and OH. These reactions leave a wide variety of ion channels and paths for formation of new ions. Although the latter process is often prohibitively expensive, the latter is worth hundreds of millions of kcal per day.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","The coincidentally substantial extent of ionic dissociation of water provides an example of BrÃ¸nsted acidity, or nucleophilic substitution at hydrogen. Relative pK values are insensitive enough to solvent that they provide insight on the role of energy-match, overlap, and resonance in ionic dissociation. The titration of alanine in water illustrates the experimental determination of pK values and the phenomenon of buffering. The limited pK scale in water can be extended dramatically by titration in other solvents, providing one of the best ways to measure many âeffectsâ in organic chemistry. A wide range of important organic reactions discovered in the 19 century and many biochemical reactions can be understood under the rubric of nucleophilic substitution.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
48,Part spin-spin splitting in the form of a two-membered ring is used to measure the NMR spectroscopy used in organic chemistry. A chemical shift is caused by the mixing of electrons in the same space as in the neighboring molecules. The change in charge density in a hydrogen atom is also affected by the change in electron density. The relative number of protons and neutrons in a molecule is also used to illustrate the importance of ion channels in dynamics.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011),"Through-space interaction between magnets of fixed strength and orientation averages to zero during random molecular tumbling, suggesting that the local field about a proton should be sensitive only to electrons that orbit about itself. The chemical shift can be sensitive to electrons orbiting elsewhere if the amount of orbiting varies with molecular orientation. This âdiamagnetic anisotropyâ is commonly used to rationalize the unusual chemical shifts of protons in acetylene and in aromatic and antiaromatic compounds. The other source of a protonâs local field is nearby magnetic nuclei, which can be counted by the splitting multiplicity. Unlike chemical shift, which is measured in fractional units because it depends on the strength of the applied field, this spin-spin splitting (), measured in Hz, is dependent only on molecular structure.Â depends not on spatial proximity, but on orbital overlap, which, remarkably, is larger for anti- than for eclipsed conformations.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
49,"Whykenes are especially stable because of the steric effect of addition to covalent isomerization. The structure of an isomer is then determined by a computer to determine the degree of stableness. The isomerâs repulsion from the hydrogens can be studied in analogous terms. Similar techniques have been used to demonstrate how to detect the presence of chlorine in viscous solvents, but this time the focus is on the isomer rather than the crystal lattice. The logic allows choosing whether or not a particular acid should be considered in such cases.Professor McBrideâ�Aristotleâ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a analyzes the stereochemistry of alkenes and their crystalline osazones. The majority of the lecture is then spent on understanding how reaction mechanisms occur in fluids (both quantitative and qualitative).","Substitution stabilizes alkenes, and addition of acids is thermodynamically favorable in acidic media.Â Addition to alkenes can involve free-radical, metal-catalyzed, and stepwise electrophilic mechanisms, the last a cation intermediate. Electrostatics can help position an attacking electrophile like H, but bonding to Markovnikov addition requires orbital mixing to form the more stable cation.Â Relative cation stability can be understood in terms of hyperconjugation, hybridization, and solvation or polarizability. Stabilization of a carbocation methide shift can compete with its trapping by solvent.Â The curious relative rates in stepwise addition of HCl or HBr to alkynes show that halogen substituents are both electron withdrawing and electron donating.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
50,"Professorhenylmethyl is a generic form of triphenylmethane, and its biosynthesis can be studied by analogous techniques. The primary challenge in Friedel-Craftsâs synthesis is the notion of molecular rotation. The use of enols to convert pentavalent carbon to terpene is discussed in some detail. The â½-octetopropanes are also proposed as an alternative way to go about synthesizing tetraphenyl mixtures from phenyl- or acyl-substituted alkanes.Professor McBride introduces the Tanner-Craft mechanism of triphanylmethylbutadiene dehydrogenase to familiarize the minds of chemists with the realities of modern organic chemistry.DanielÂ Kahneman analyzes the conformational relationships of ketones and carbenes according to which the carbonyl compounds are mixed up in a single triphenilemethylmethylmethylpotassium ATPase intermediate.

51,Professorroscopic spectroscopy deals primarily with the mixing of electrons in the orbitals of the H atom. The majority of molecules analyzed agree on three principles: 1) Avoid mixing with dark energy; 2) Mixing up of electronsâs energy with kinetic energy; 3) Remember that your data must be averaged over time to understand the dynamics of molecules. Using this method we can estimate the molecular structure of a molecule by looking at the electron distribution in the same space.,"Time-dependent quantum mechanics shows how mixing orbitals of different energy causes electrons to vibrate. Mixing with causes a vibration that can absorb or generate light, while mixing with causes âbreathingâ that does not interact with light. Many natural organic chromophores involve mixing an unshared electron pair with a vacant pi orbital, whose conjugation determines color. Infrared spectra reveal atomic vibration frequencies, which are related by Hookeâs law to bond strengths and âreducedâ masses. Infrared spectra are complicated by the coupling of local oscillators of similar frequency to give ânormalâ modes. Alkane chains possess characteristic stretching and bending modes, with descriptive names, that may, or may not, absorb infrared light.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
52,"The Baeyer-Villiger mechanism is involved in the aggregation of alkanes and carboxylic acids into ketones. Artificial or natural ion carriers (ionuclides) can be interconverted by a cataclysmic eruption of water vapor that pushes surface waters over the ocean. Acidic dissociation of water from the ocean can be favored over carbohydrate digestion, but this can be avoided when the ions are sufficiently diverse. Ketenes can be oxidized to carbinolamines by an acid-catalyzed tetrahedral intermediate.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","When a nucleophilic atom bearing a good leaving group attacks a carbonyl group, an adjacent Rgroup can migrate to the new atom, inserting it into the R-acyl bond. This mechanism can insert O, NH, or CH groups into the acyl bond with informative stereospecificity in the case of the Beckmann rearrangement of oximes. Although the migrating groups are formally anionic, relative migratory aptitudes show that they give up electron density during rearrangement. Acid dissociation of protons aÂ to a carbonyl group to form enolates, and the ease of forming enols, gives Î±-carbons nucleophilic reactivity under both basic and acidic conditions. This explains H/D exchange and racemization as well as halogenation and alkylation of Î±-carbons.Professor McBrideâs website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)"
53,"Professor Kleiner discusses the civic history of Roman North Africa from its beginnings in A.D. 62 to the end of the Roman Empire. She features typical late Republican temples at Rome, Bath, and Vaison-la-Romaine, a Roman copy of an original Greek painting commissioned by Cornelius Severus. Situated on the Oppian and Esquiline Hills, the city of Leptis Magna is an eclectic mix of Greek domesticity, Roman culture, and history that contrasts sharply with that of Neroâs Domitianum. The lecture analyzes the funerary architecture of Septimius Severus and his wife, Julia Domna. Professor Kleiner also highlights the suburban Villa of Belvigne (Neo-Roman), a Roman villa on the northwest coast of Italy. City planning in this area is also discussed, as are urban institutions like the Hagia Sophia and the various Roman cities surveyed in the region. The idea of the â½pious was not unique among the political movements of the time; however, it nonetheless drew great admiration.","Professor Kleiner discusses two Roman cities in North Africa: Timgad and Leptis Magna. Timgad was created as an entirely new colony for Roman army veterans by Trajan in A.D. 100, and designed all at once as an idealÂ Â plan. Leptis Magna, conversely, grew more gradually from its Carthaginian roots, experiencing significant Roman development under Augustus and Hadrian. Septimius Severus, the first Roman emperor from North Africa, was born at Leptis and his hometown was renovated in connection with his historic visit to the city. This large-scale program of architectural expansion features the Severan Forum and Basilica and the nearby Arch of Septimius Severus, aÂ or four-sided arch located at the crossing of two major streets. The lecture culminates with the unique Hunting Baths, a late second or early third-century structure built for a group of entrepreneurs who supplied exotic animals to Romeâs amphitheaters. Its intimate vaulted spaces are revealed on the outside of the building and silhouetted picturesquely against the sea, suggesting that the bathâs owners knew how to innovate through concrete architecture and"
54,"Professor Kleiner discusses the Baroque element in Roman architecture in the second half of the Roman period, an element that brings together elements from Greek and Etruscan architectural styles. The primary features of this type of architecture are the use of columns and entablature to create a sense of undulation. City planning in such an area is also discussed, with examples of baroque-style buildings taking on an eclectic mix of vistas and panoramic views. The lecture ends with a discussion of the resort town of Ostia, a lively terraced complex that uses concrete to transform a mountain into a work of architecture.","Professor Kleiner features the baroque phenomenon in Roman architecture, in which the traditional vocabulary of architecture, consisting of columns and other conventional architectural elements, is manipulated to enliven building faÃ§ades and inject them with dynamic motion. This baroque trend is often conspicuously ornamental and began to be deployed on the walls of forums and tombs in Italy already in the late first century A.D. But baroque architecture in Roman antiquity was foremost in the Greek East where high-quality marble and expert marble carvers made it the architectural mode of choice. At Petra in Jordan, tomb chambers were cut into cliffs and elaborate faÃ§ades carved out of the living rock. The cities of Miletus and Ephesus in Asia Minor were adorned with gates and fountains and libraries and stage buildings that consisted of multi-storied columnar screens. The lecture culminates with the Sanctuary of Jupiter Heliopolitanus, a massive temple complex at Baalbek in Lebanon, with Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus in enormous scale and with extreme embellishment, and the Temple of Venus with an undulating lintel that foreshadows the curvilinear flourishes of Francesco Borrominiâ"
55,"Guest. Ashley Gearhardt explores the issue of food and addiction. She describes the biological, physical, psychological characteristics of taste and eating, and how it is measured. She also draws from her own experiences as a parent to understand the emotional basis for her own overeating. She then turns to a discussion of the cultural differences between different types of eating, drinking, tobacco consumption, and binge eating. She uses examples from film to show how people are eating too much or too little of different classes of sugars and fats.","Ashley Gearhardt gives a guest presentation about the relationship between food and addiction, and how emerging clinical research suggests that eating maps onto a model of addiction. Professor Kelly Brownell reviews how culture affects eating, from whatâs acceptable to eat to how to eat it. He reviews cultural differences between the American and French food cultures. He then suggests how American values are changing through recent movements which are concerned with the story of food and the features of food before it is consumed."
56,"Professor Brownell offers a guest lecture on food and the psychology of it. First, Professor Brownell explores the relationship between diet and politics, with an emphasis on whether or not food is a good and a bad. He then turns his attention to the topic of how our food choices are affected by our current diet. What is it about our food tastes? Professor Brownall then explores the biological basis for our responses to different types of pollutants, from apples to oranges to macronutrients to macrons and macronuts to microneutrients and micronutadiene. The lecture concludes with a discussion of water management in the American West.","Professor Brownell gives an overview of the course agenda. The psychological issues of food are introduced, such as who defines food, what promotes health, and how the food industry contributes to both debates. The biological issues that will be discussed include how peopleâs hard-wired preferences interact with a modern food environment. The political issues of the class will integrate food production, consumption, marketing, and world politics, with discussion of potential interventions for changing food preferences and food intake patterns in society."
57,"Professor Brownell discusses the Yale Sustainable Food Program, an initiative that raises issues of sustainability, world hunger, and contributes to a discussion of sustainable food programs. The lecture describes the organizationâs transition from a small, nonprofit organization to a national government agency with a national portfolio of money and resources. Professor Brownell explores the different types of federal agencies that participate in this transition, including the Connecticut State Department of Education, the Yale School Lunch Program, the New Haven town planning program, and the various types of parks and protected areas. He also touches on the future of sustainable foods in the American West.","Two guest speakers share their experiences in changing the food environment in their local communities. Melina Shannon-DiPietro describes how the Yale Sustainable Food Project changes peopleâs connection with food at Yale and reflects a growing national and academic trend. Jennifer McTiernan describes the development and goals of CitySeed, highlighting the power of individuals and communities to make change."
58,"Guest Brownell talks about success stories in the food environment. He explores how the issues of diet and what people choose to eat are also addressed. Professor Brownell then reviews the three main types of factors that contribute to the food crisis: poverty, hunger, and disease. He then touches on whether our food environment is currently either too dry or too wet. He ends with a discussion of Barack Obamaâs election; his 2008 inauguration; and his speech during the signing of the Treaty of Paris.","Professor Brownell concludes the course by exploring the question of how to change the food environment. He identifies health, environment and social justice as three broad reasons for changing the food environment and highlights the need to unite these initiatives. To address the questions of who creates change and how it happens, Professor Brownell explores top-down change and bottom-up change. As exemplars of both types, he reviews the issue of menu-labeling laws and identifies people who have inspired big change through local action. He then ends by summarizing what his goals have been for the course throughout the semester and highlights the need for innovative change on a variety of levels."
59,"Guest Brownell discusses the courseâs academic requirements, including research opportunities. Specific topics will include: diet, drugs, and alcohol. Professor Brownell also introduces the history of how our food system compares to that of other disciplines in the study. He reviews the different types of influences that are having a profound impact on our food choices.","This lecture explores how the mismatch between evolution and the current food environment has changed peopleâs relationship to food. Ancient societies had a vastly different food environment compared to modern day societies, which was characterized by unpredictable food supply, the threat of starvation, and a high priority to bank energy. The human brain evolved for this ancient food environment, which creates challenges in the modern food environment where people have unfettered access to the high sugar, high fat, high variety foods that they are programmed to find appealing."
60,"Sexualates of sex are very different from males and females of the same species. Sex is not particularly strong unless one understands the evolutionary basis for attraction. For most of the history of sex, there have been two predominant types of responses to this type of activity: initiation, promiscuity, and profiteering. One is considering the evolutionary explanation for why some regions of the world are more virgins than others. Another is considering how arousal is generated by predators.","This lecture reviews what evolutionary theories and recent studies in psychology can tell us about sex and gender differences. Students will hear how psychology can help explain many of the differences that exist in whom we find attractive, what we desire in a mate, and sexual orientation."
61,"Professor lecture offers an introduction to dualism. It begins with an explanation of why we are different from the rest of the universe: because we are not âall rational,â½� we are interested in what other people think we will do. This is followed by a discussion of the idea of the phasic treadmill, in which the treadmill is used to measure mental abilities. Finally, Professor Gendler discusses the evolutionary basis for the study of the mind and how it allows us to predict what will make us happiest. The lecture concludes with a discussion on the beauty of the human mind.","This lecture introduces students to two broad theories of how the mind relates to the body. Dualism is the ubiquitous and intuitive feeling that our conscious mind is separate from our physical bodies, whereas Materialism is the idea that all of our mental states are caused by physical states of the brain. This lecture reviews arguments explaining why materialism has become the predominant theory of mind in psychology. This discussion is followed by a basic overview of the neurophysiology of the brain."
62,"The United Statesâ fragmented, piecemeal approach to environmental law reflects a view of the nature of the American citizenry. The evolution of the Clean Water Act reflects changes in scientific understanding of the issue from the 1950s to the 1990s. The variety of federal agencies and levels of government involved in creating and implementing regulations contribute to a fragmentation of American environmental law. Environmental law seeks to balance the costs of environmental degradation with the economic benefits that companies reap.","Professor John Wargo introduces the central question of the course, âCan law shape a sustainable future for ten billion people?â The purpose of the course is to examine the most important U.S. laws adopted over the past forty years, and to evaluate their effectiveness. Lectures will present histories of nuclear experimentation, industrial and organic agriculture, air quality, plastics, wilderness, green building certification, and land use regulation. By the end of the course students will be exposed to diverse statutory and regulatory strategies to prevent pollution, reduce wastes, protect human health, conserve energy, and to protect wild lands."
63,"The plastics industry is considered to be one of the most important failures of environmental law. The government has used warnings, control over advertising, and age restrictions to regulate pesticides. The tobacco industry has been able to complicate efforts to impose stricter regulations on pesticide use due to its power in the media due to ad sales and government due to the importance of cigarette sales taxes to state governments.","Plastics are omnipresent but minimally understood and regulated in the United States. The lecture focuses on the dangers that chemicals in plastics pose to human health, particularly via leaching into food and water. Plastics are regulated by the Toxic Substance Control Act, which gives the Environmental Protection Agency the responsibility of testing to ensure that plastics do not adversely affect human health. When plastics can leach into food, the Food and Drug Administration can demand testing. Professor Wargo shows how oversights have led to limited labeling of hazardous plastics, which results in consumers having limited means of protecting themselves from harm."
64,"The illustrate the difficulties faced in managing technological risks, Professor Wargo describes the Atomic Energy Commissionâs nuclear tests in the 1950s. He describes the use of radionuclides to measure the persistence of pollutants in the environment. The Atomic Energy commissionâs storage facility at Cape Cod National Seashore is used as a case study of the ways to manage risks while both continuing the development of new technologies and keeping the secret for national security reasons.","The United States government employed a variety of approaches to protect citizens from danger, including public education, nuclear weapons testing, and gathering data about the effects of nuclear testing. The U.S. governmentâs testing of nuclear weapons at the Bikini Atoll is used as an example of government approaches. Nuclear testing led to ecological devastation, leading the U.S. government to move Bikinians to another island. The case highlights the far-reaching environmental, economic, and health consequences of nuclear weapons testing."
65,"The poetry of the late nineteenth century is presented as an introduction to the literature of the twentieth century. Students will hear about the major themes of the course, including regionalism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, and cosmopolitanism. The final two lectures will consider the works of major poets in the period, such as Austen, Eliot, and the BrontÃ«s.","Professor Hammer introduces students to the material that will be covered in the course of the semester. Course readings and requirements are also addressed. Early publications of poems are discussed as they appeared in small magazines such asÂ,Â, andÂ. Book publication of the same poems and other poetry collections are then discussed in contrast. A number of modern English poets are presented such as Eliot, Hughes, Moore, Yeats, and photographs are shown in order to introduce students to the major poets of the early twentieth century."
66,"The this second lecture on Craneâs poetry, Professor Paul Fry explores the relationship betweenÂ Â and â½�Voyages II.â�A Crane is interested in the ways that his poetic project relates to and engages with the lived world. The idea of the self is represented as something different than the realm of the imagination; it is not an object for idolatry or profanation; it represents a place where the self can be reclaimed from the past by the other. Crane also draws distinctions between Crane (Ã¡ratus) and Eliot (Ã©). The poemâ� Aeneas, Î±a, is considered as a contemplation of Craneâ­�s idiosyncratic use of language.","Hart Craneâs masterworkÂ Â is positioned as a response to the modernist aesthetics of T.S. EliotâsÂ. The visionary and specifically American aspects of the epic are stressed. Craneâs interest in myth and symbol, his inclusion and treatment of marginal figures, and his refiguring of the American hero are considered alongside his unique perspective on the role of imagination in the creation and shaping of history."
67,"The poetry ofÂ Â is discussed in some detail. The poemâs preoccupation with the lives of the dead and the living is considered as a contemplation of the nature of the sacred. â½ the poem also explores the idea of the â­�signs,ââââ�ETRY OF FROST edited by Edward Connery Lathem. Copyright 1916, 1969, 1944 by Lesley Ballantine, copyright 1936, 1944. Reprinted by permission of Henry Holt and Company, LLC.","In this lecture, Professor Hammer considers the psycho-sexual aspects of T.S. Eliotâs,Â. The landscape of the poem is described and its key figures introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on couples and scenes of dialogue with aspects of romantic or sexual distress. At the lectureâs conclusion, a broad summation of the individual units of the poem is presented, and the editing process, in particular Ezra Poundâs contributions, is reflected upon."
68,"The the first of two lectures on âThe Song of the Wandering Aengusâ½� is presented as an alternative to the traditional forms found in Audenâ�Aengus. The Song ofthe Wandering aengus is considered as an expression of Audenian conceptions of love. â§�s poetics of sensual mediation, such as the voice of the wind, is explored in connection with Imagism. Auden draws a contrast between his poetic vocation and that of the Siren inÂ Â 2. In Î±, the poet seems to point to the role of the siren in Î²-XXVIII. His ode, Î¨±, is interpreted as an ironic meditation on the loss of the sound of language.","In this second lecture on W.H. Auden, the relationship between art and suffering is considered in Audenâs treatment of Brueghelâs âFall of Icarusâ in the poem âMusÃ©e des Beaux Arts.â Audenâs reflections on the place of art in society are explored in the elegies âIn Memory of W.B. Yeatsâ and âIn Memory of Sigmund Freud,â where Freudâs âtalking cureâ is recast as a model for poetry-making. Finally, âIn Praise of Limestoneâ is considered as a late allegorical vision of a secular, non-transcendental earthly paradise."
69,"In this final lecture of the course, Professor Hungerford considers the various ways in which authors can engage in a discussion of the Identity Plot. She shows how Foerâs ambitions for a wide-ranging reading of the novel fall into two categories: the Imagining Talent and the Individual Talent. While the Talent Plot is an innovative form of narrative art, it ultimately construes the specificity of persons to be its very concealment. As such, it comes as no surprise that the novelist chooses not to reveal the inner recesses of the past in a novel that celebrates the power of narrative fiction.","In her final lecture of the course, Professor Hungerford evaluates Jonathan Safran Foerâs Â with respect to one of her areas of expertise, American writing about the Holocaust. She points out how the novel takes on some of the questions of trauma theory in its examination of both the pain and the healing power of repetition. The most innovative characteristic of Foerâs novel is, for Hungerford, the way it addresses the inheritance of the Holocaust for third-generation Jews in America. The novel finds new ways to provide witness for and connection to their grandparentsâ experiences in Europe, but also displaces a traditional Holocaust discovery narrative from the Jewish child of survivors to the Eastern European grandchild of those complicit in the destruction ofÂ life."
70,"Professor this first of two lectures on, Professor Hungerford discusses the novelâs ambiguity as a representation of violence. Hungerford shows how the novel borrows narrative techniques from other authors, such as flashback, siren, and tic-tac-toe. The novel also includes an element of itself that brings together the elements of different types of characters, acting as if they were never heard of before. As Hungerford demonstrates, the novel incorporates elements of Modernist and late Modernist conceptions of violence in its presentation of the novel, as well as the New Critical writing program of which Hungerford is a product.","In this first of two lectures on, Professor Hungerford walks us through some of the novelâs major sources and influences, showing how McCarthy engages both literary tradition and American history, and indeed questions of origins and originality itself. The Bible,,, the poetry of William Wordsworth, and the historical narrative of Sam Chamberlain all contribute to the style and themes of this work that remains, in its own right, a provocative meditation on history, one that explores the very limits of narrative and human potential."
71,"In Barthâs short novel, Ambrose His Mark, is a classic short story of narrative seduction. Barriers to the specificity of the wordplay are presented, including the repeated use of enjambment and profanation. The irony, however, is that this short novel conforms to the conventions of the ancient Greeks and even outlives the limits of what can be accomplished by a single paragraph of monologue. Barth also draws distinctions between his own creation of mythological figures, such as Medusa and Mulciber, and between the different types of characters encountered in the picaresque. Finally, the author makes an unapologetically Romantic journey through the comforts of the past, setting the stage for the emergence of the modern novel from its seedier beginnings.","In her lecture on John Barthâs collection of stories, Professor Amy Hungerford delves beyond the superficial pleasures and frustrations of Barthâs oft-cited metafictional masterwork to illuminate the profound commitment to language that his narrative risks entail. Foremost among Barthâs concerns, Hungerford argues, is the multi-faceted relationship between language and love. Desire can drive a narrative, or disrupt it. Language can create desire, or replace it. Unifying the virtuosic variety of his tales is Barthâs inquiry: Does language always stand in for a loss of bodily presence? Must the written word always exist as the shadow of the oral?"
72,"Professor this lecture, Professor Holloway explores the history of censorship in the United States. He explores the origins of black history, from the American Civil War through the National Black Political Convention in 1945, to the debates over representation in the 1940s. The central figure in these debates is Stokely Carmichael. Although his narrative differs markedly from that of Hitler, it nevertheless has a high level of tradition and political orientations.","In this lecture Professor Hungerford discusses how the novels we read are shaped by legal and market constraints. She traces a history of censorship from the Comstock laws, to the policing of Joyceâs and GinsbergâsÂ, and shows how changes in publishing practices have tended to penalize more unusual, less profitable books. Hungerford also touches on the canon debates of the 80s and 90s (citing John Guillory and Toni Morrison), and the issues of intellectual property and internationalization raised by digital literature. Finally, she points to some ways that Philip Roth, despite his controversial representations of Judaism and of women, succeeds in tackling fundamental human concerns."
73,"Professor discussion of the nature of history continues but this time the focus is on the Archangel Raphaelâs prophetic vision of the emergence of a new man, Adam. The Archangel Raphael appears to point out that the creation of the Republic is predicated on an attempt to justify the existence of an inferior form of human authority: the â½�veil of sin.â� The irony, however, is that the Archangel Michaelâ= Â is not concerned with the story of the Fall; rather, his concern with the details of the fallen is explored in light of the mythological figures of the first two books, such as Medusa and Mulciber. Overall, the tension between Christian and classical figures is underscored at the numerical center of the poem, where the angel from the Heaven of the Fixed Stars appears to represent the new figure.","Books Eleven and Twelve of and their radical departure from the poemâs previous style are discussed. The transformation of Miltonâs famously sonorous verse into a more didactic mode is closely documented, and the poemâs increasing emphasis on visual instruction is underscored in a study of the Archangel Michaelâs lesson on the history of the post-fallen world. Considerable time is devoted to both a consideration of Miltonâs late politics and Book Elevenâs depiction of the destruction of paradise."
74,"Theiltonâs violent response to the problem of sexuality is discussed. The poem â½�Milton, Power, and the Power of the Commonsâ is presented as an instance of Miltonâ¡« engaging in a political process that is entirely outside of his theological commitments. The failure of humanity to work real change is dramatized by an attempt to silence the opposition posed by the seventeenth-century reader, Adam and Eve. Finally, the question of artistic originality is addressed, with particular emphasis placed on the poemâ­�s peculiar association of sexuality with violence.","An introduction to John Milton: man, poet, and legend. Miltonâs place at the center of the English literary canon is asserted, articulated, and examined through a discussion of Miltonâs long, complicated association with literary power. The conception of Miltonic power and its calculated use in political literature is analyzed in the feminist writings of Lady Mary Chudleigh, Mary Astell, and Virginia Woolf. Later the god-like qualities often ascribed to Miltonic authority are considered alongside Satanâs excursus on the constructed nature of divine might in, and the notorious characterâs method of analysis is shown to be a useful mode of encountering the author himself."
75,"Theiltonâs relationship to the New Testament is explored, along with the Son in his role as spokesman for Satan. The Sonâ�Aristotle criticizes the poemâ½�s monistic elements, pointing out that the Son is just a collection of elusive things, such as beauty, justice, goodness, and so on. The poetâ sanguine attitude toward the world below is explored in Books One and Two of Particular Attention is paid to the poem â² which deals primarily with the issues of identity and interpretation. The authorâÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a comments on the poem before moving on to the problems of reconciling the dual identities of God and Satan.","In this second lecture on, the three temptations are examined and Miltonâs unusual departure from their account in the Gospel of Luke is discussed. The poemâs tacit assertion of the superiority of knowledge and ethics over action is probed. Considerable time is spent examining the Sonâs rejection of classical literature. Finally, Book Fourâs allusion to the riddle of the sphinx serves as a springboard to a consideration of the poemâs Oedipal elements."
76,"This second lecture on looks at hell and its inhabitants, as depicted in Books Two and three of Particular attention is paid to Miltonâs blindness. Particular focus is placed on the poemâ½â particularly the depiction of the angel in Book Two of theÂ. The Archangel Raphaelâ± is read as a representation of the immaterial being, with particular emphasis placed on his stance against the supernatural. The poetâ is shown to move from one level to another in his quest to recuperate the immorality of the Deuteronomistic School.","This lecture focuses on the invocation to light at the beginning of Book Three ofÂ. Miltonâs factual and figurative understanding of his blindness is traced through his letters, Sonnet XXII, and the later epicÂ. Particular emphasis is placed on the transformation of blindness in the corpus from a spiritual punishment to a poetic gift. The implications of biographical interpretations of literature are also touched upon."
77,"Thisiltonâs dilemma is explored in the context of the book of Judges. The author of the Hebrew Bible, Samson, is shown to do many of the same things that we might expect from a text: repent, petition, cursing, and cursing. Finally, the question of the rightness of God is expounded upon.","In the final lecture of the course, the analysis of comes to a conclusion with an exploration of the poemâs sexual imagery. Miltonâs choice of subject matter is puzzled over, as are the ethics of his tragic hero, particularly when compared to the heroes of Miltonâs previous epics. The poem is positioned as a means by which Milton ultimately resolves the poetic, religious, and career-related crises of his earlier poem, âThe Passion,â and the compelling relationship between the corpus and the poetâs biography is revisited one final time."
78,"This this second lecture on, Professor Miltonâs sequel to theÂ Â is discussed with particular attention paid to its similarity to the first. The nature of Miltonian self-characterization, both Romantic and erotic, is explored in the context of his fascism, anti-capitalism, and xenophobia. The irony, however, is that the sequel comes from the same author, rather than the other way around. The problem of reconciling the conflicting perspectives of the two is then addressed, with particular emphasis placed on the poemââ�Ace, which seems more exploitative than expansive.","This lecture treats the first two books of the sequel to,. The difference in style and subject matter is described. The poemâs depiction of the Son of God and Satan, specifically the charactersâ seeming inability to recollect any of the events ofÂ cor the Bible, is closely analyzed. At the lectureâs conclusion, similarities between the Sonâs slowly developing sense of his identity and Miltonâs own narrative of his poetic development are examined."
79,"M this second lecture on, Professor Miltonâs foreknowledge of the impending end of theÂ Â is stressed. The reductive forces of the bookâ½ reveal various levels of preoccupation with the imagery of the Nativity, its poles of prophecy, and its peculiar temporal ambiguity. The authorâ sardonically indirect depictions of the parable of the angel in the New Testament are contrasted with the realistic depiction of the Archangel Michaelâ­ in Books I and II. Finally, the Christian elements of the story are explored with a view to the heroic actions of Michael as a representation of the prophetic self-consciousness we take for granted.","In this final lecture on, Book Twelveâs justification for the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden is examined alongside the Genesis account. The nature of Miltonâs God, whether literal or liberal, is examined at length. The poemâs closing lines are closely read, with substantial attention paid to Miltonâs final, complicated take on the poem-long consideration of Providence and free will."
80,"In Fredric Jameson, a New Haven native, offers an option of a political approach to literature, in opposition to the Eurocentricism of the Marxists and Nietzsche. The theoretical writings of Walter Benjamin and Hans Robert Nemiroff are explored in some detail, including their use of expository language without meter or rhyme. Invoking the nineteenth-century novel ofÂ, Jameson argues that the romances of Homer and Don Quixote represent a necessary step in the development of realism in the twentieth century. He goes on to explore the relation between realism and history, pointing out that the modernist novel seems to point to the emergence of literary forms in the nineteenth century from the duke and duchessâs dream of the polis. Finally, he comments on the relation among different types of sources, such as mythological figures, present time and space.","In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores Fredric Jamesonâs seminal work,Â, as an outcropping of Marxist literary criticism and structural theory. Texts such as Shelleyâs âOde to the West Windâ and Shakespeareâs seventy-third sonnet are examined in the context of Jamesonâs three horizons of underlying interpretive frameworksâthe political, the social, and the historical, each carefully explained. The extent to which those frameworks permeate individual thought is addressed in a discussion of Jamesonâs concept of the âideologeme.â The theoristâs work is juxtaposed with the writings of Bakhtin and Levi-Strauss. The lecture concludes by revisiting the childrenâs storyÂ, upon which Jamesonâs theory of literature is mapped."
81,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the relationship between semiotics and New Criticism. Considerable attention is paid to Knapp and Michaelsâ essay, âYalieââ½� in which the young scholars defend their claim that free will is the key to unlocking the power of the imagination. The idea of autonomous art is explored in connection with the work of Gilles Deleuze, Jakobson, Saussure, Bakhtin, de Man, Fish and Knapp.","In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry takes on Knapp and Michaelsâs influential article, âAgainst Theory.â The historical context of the piece is given and key aspects of the theoristsâ critical orientations, specifically their neo-pragmatism, are defined. A lengthy discussion of the relationships between, on the one hand, intention and meaning and, on the other hand, language and speech follows with reference to Saussure, deconstruction, and Russian formalism. Knapp and Michaelsâs use of Wordsworthâs âA Slumber Did My Spirit Sealâ to explore the limits of meaning and intention is examined in depth. Ultimately, the case is made, using issues subject to dispute in Knapp and Michaels, that theoryÂ Â a useful and necessary tool in literary studies."
82,"Professor this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Claude Levi-Strauss and Stanley Fish. Derridaâs essay, â½�The Politics of Derrid,â is a contemplation of the relationship between history and politics, in particular the relation between rhetoric and sociology. Fish draws on his own experiences as a writer to delve into the political issues raised by Jews in the Western West. The distinction he draws between Derrin and Bloom is then drawn between the theoretical writings of Yeats and Hernando de Soto, respectively. In the second half of the lecture, an examination of the methodological structures of modernist criticism is shown to highlight the tension between the works of major thinkers, such as Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and de Man.","In this lecture on Derrida and the origins of deconstruction, Professor Paul Fry explores two central Derridian works: âStructure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of Human Sciencesâ and âDiffÃ©rance.â Derridaâs critique of structuralism and semiotics, particularly the work of Levi-Strauss and Saussure, is articulated. Deconstructionâs central assertions that language is by nature arbitrary and that meaning is indeterminate are examined. Key concepts, such as the nature of the text, discourse,Â, and supplementarity are explored."
83,"The discussion of hermeneutics continues. The idea of interpretation is explored in connection with the Protestant Reformation. Through a comparative analysis of the writings of Paul Fry, Professor Donald Kagan explores the difference between meaning and significance. He argues that the Protestant church eventually turns into a religion of free will, according to which the open road becomes the domain of Satan. Through his investigation, the author was able to provide an alternative narrative of the emergence of Christianity from its seedier beginnings.","In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines acts of reading and interpretation by way of the theory of hermeneutics. The origins of hermeneutic thought are traced through Western literature. The mechanics of hermeneutics, including the idea of a hermeneutic circle, are explored in detail with reference to the works of Hans-George Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, and E. D. Hirsch. Particular attention is paid to the emergence of concepts of âhistoricismâ and âhistoricalityâ and their relation to hermeneutic theory."
84,"Professor GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­aâs novel is the first of a series of Spanish novels that aim to bring together the fragmentation of the world into a single, unified novel. In part one of theÂ, the hero falls prey to what he calls â½�anachronism,â� a form of anti-modernity that makes him unique and yet attractive, even if ugly. Don Quixoteâs comments on his own experiences as a writer are read with an emphasis on theÂ Â as a representation of those encountered in Part II. The irony, however, is that the novel participates in a larger cultural process than is normally associated with the religion of the sixteenth century. Avellaneda draws parallels between both Cervantes and Rousseau by showing how theÂ. The novel also shows the similarities between literature and history, pointing out that the two cannot be totally separated. Fiction is not an essential characteristic of the novel and so it is relevant to our lives.","The professor introduces himself and the course. He starts by explaining the reasons why is a masterpiece and its place and relevance in the history of Western literature. He then comments on the proper pronunciation of the word âQuixoteâ and the reasons for the mispronunciations in French and English. A full explanation of the real title of the work () follows, along with some key clarifications about the language of the book and a few basic notes on historical and cultural background. GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a then moves on to the present, commenting on âs legacy in the Western world, proved by the use of words such as âquixotic,â and the success of its myth up to the present. He finishes his lecture by going back to its beginning, referring to the reasons for the endurance of this work, which relies on its deep questioning of the human self. The session ends with an overview of the syllabus."
85,"The the difference between romance and novel, Cervantes explores the relationship between literature and culture. The first half of the lecture turns to the question of why literature is so different from the traditional one: what is it to be known? Then we return to the discussion of the origins of literature in the context of the modernists, with particular attention paid to the relation between literatureâs ambitions and that of the common man. The second half of this lecture moves on to the topic of the originality of literature. A dialogue is then drawn between GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a and Don Quixote about what constitutes an originality. The two are explored in light of the mythological figures of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, who are said to inhabit the same space as did the book of the first caryatids. The story of Marcela and GrisÃ³stomo is a picaresque autobiography in which the author participates in a mystical tradition not connected with the literary genre previously occupied by theÂ. Avellaneda draws parallels between theÂ Â and the novel of the fourth caryas, with the episode of the duke and duchess","Why does the Â have such common currency today? GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a believes that theÂ Â is about the effect that literature has on its readers and about the creation of literature. Its story does not belong to any previous tradition but it is a new story, and this act of invention by a fifty-year old man, Cervantes, is in itself part of modern literature. GonzÃ¡lez EchevarrÃ­a comments on why the creation of this work was possible in the Spain of the seventeenth century and, after making some important distinctions between the concepts novel and romance, chivalric romances and courtly romance, explains that the is the first novel because it portrays the clash between the protagonist and his setting for the first time. He then talks about the âs precursors in the picaresque novel and the beginnings of realism. The lecture ends with a thorough commentary on the prologue, its intentions and meanings, along with the concepts of authorship, the legitimation of literature, and ultimately, self invention."
86,"Professor this lecture, Professor Saltzman introduces the physiology of the organ system. Specific topics include: how cell communication in the blood is regulated by the innate and adaptive immune system; how pathogens communicate in the same way; whatâs called an â½anorexic lipids are used to measure the fitness of mammalian cells in the body; how antibodies work to bind specific molecules; and how pathogens will communicate in a wide variety of ways.","Professor Saltzman talks about cell communication, specifically ligand-receptor interactions that are important in maintaining homeostasis in the body. Different types of receptors and ligands, the nature of their interactions and ways to apply this into developing drugs are discussed (eg. Aldopa, Taximofen, beta-blockers). Next, Professor Saltzman talks about kinases, phosphatases, cyclic AMP and the mechanism of switching protein states. Three categories of cell communication signals are introduced: autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine. Finally, an example of cell communication using regulation/response to blood sugar level is presented."
87,"Professor Saltzman introduces the cell culture concept of mitosis. Specific topics include how cells develop into multi-cell organisms, how pathogens will respond to their treatments, and how pathogensâ responses will differ across tissues. The majority of cells in the body are involved in some way or another. There is a close analogy between the chromosomes and the mitochondrion in an organism, and the cell division in the heart. Immune response by cytotoxic T cells to antigen recognition is also discussed.","Professor Saltzman describes the processes of fertilization and embryogenesis. Professor Saltzman then talks about the definition and classification of different types of stem cells, where stem cells are found in the body, and the potential for use of stem cells in treating diseases. Some challenges in this type of therapy are also discussed. Finally, Professor Saltzman introduces the exponential equation for cell growth,Â, and the concept of cell âdoubling time.â"
88,"Professor begins with a discussion of the basic concepts of Biomedical Engineering. Professor Gendler introduces the concept as a structuring human health so that one understands the world in terms of what is known and unknown. She then presents the two main branches of the study: neuroscience, which is interested in the body, and psychology, which deals with the personality/body/mind/artificial distinction. This is followed by a brief discussion of some of the key concepts within the field of biomedical engineering: the regulation of the phospholipid, the specialization of nutrients, and the unipidâs effect on concentration. The final segment of the lecture talks about the different ways that we can improve human health.","Professor Saltzman introduces the concepts and applications of biomedical engineering, providing an overview of the course syllabus, reading materials for lecture and labs and grading logistics. Various pictures are shown to highlight the current application of biomedical engineering technologies in daily life (eg. chest x-ray, PET scan, operating room, gene chip, transport). Next, living standards and medical technologies of the past and present are compared to point out the impact of biomedical engineering as well as areas for improvement in the field. Finally, Professor Saltzman draws references from the poem âLondon Bridgeâ to illustrate some societal issues in making materials and devices in biomedical engineering."
89,"Professor Saltzman introduces the basic concepts of cardiovascular physiology. Professor Saltzman first introduces the anatomy of the heart, and then describes the mode of action in the heart: the blood flow through the circulatory system. Immune response by the innate and adaptive immune system is discussed in detail to stress-strain patients who are experiencing a loss of muscle mass. Next, Professor Saltz analyzes the cellular filtration rate (CFR) in the atrium and the ventricle. The effacement of water in these cells is regulated by the CardioThoracic hindrance, which is a progressive process that stimulates contraction of muscle fibers throughout the heart.","Professor Saltzman discusses the biophysics of the circulatory system. He begins by describing the anatomy of different types of blood vessels, and states the relationship between pressure difference (ÎP) as the driving force for fluid flow (Q) in a tube (i.e., blood vessel) with some resistance R (ÎP = RQ). R can be calculated using if dimensions of the tube () and fluid viscosity () are known:Â. Next, Professor Saltzman traces the blood flow through the circulatory system and explains how the body can regulate blood flow to specific regions of the body. Finally, he describes the heart and its function as the pressure generator in the system."
90,"Professor Saltzman reviews the anatomy of the heart. Specific topics covered include contraction, contraction, and contraction of the aorta, an important unit in the circulatory system. Professor Saltzman describes the mode of signal transmission in the heart: action potential in the sinus, secretion of toxic waste, and neurotransmitter release from the sinoatrial node through the glomerulus. Immune response by the innate and adaptive immune system is also discussed.","Professor Saltzman describes the blood flow through the systemic and pulmonary circulatory system. More specifically, he describes, with the help of diagrams, the events that lead to blood flow in the body as a function of contraction/relaxation by specific chambers of the heart, and the effect of four valves which help direct flow. Important terms and concepts such as systole/diastole pressures, cardiac output (CO) as a function of heart rate (HR) and ejection volume (EV), and the action potential propagation that stimulates heart muscle contraction are discussed."
91,"Professor lecture explores the issue of how cancers occur in the U.S. and internationally. The American Cancer Society has found that cancer is very common both worldwide and in the US. There is a history of research conducted after the death of a loved one, and this has led to a number of congressional investigations. The Congressional Radicals have used warnings, control over advertising, and age restrictions to combat the epidemic.","Professor Saltzman uses cancer diagnosis and treatment as an example to demonstrate the some applications of biomedical engineering technologies and methods. Some issues involved in cancer treatment, such as tumor angiogenesis, radiation sensitivity, drug localization, and cancer stem cells are mentioned. Next, he describes the phases (I-IV), in compliance to guidelines enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which a new drug compound must go through to gain approval prior to public distribution/sale. Finally, Professor Saltzman draws attention to the areas that biomedical engineers may contribute to, to improve this process."
92,"Professorray imaging is a special form of X-ray imaging in which the source of X radiation (in this case, the image of the axial location) is used to create contrast. X-rays from the source can be used to generate an X-Ray image reminiscent of oneâs own image. In this way, the contrast provided by the X- rays is very different from that generated by the initial wave. Difficulties with resolution of large distances are then discussed. Finally, Professor Saltzman describes the different ways in which radionuclides are transported to and from the body.","Professor Saltzman continues his discussion of biomedical imaging technology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is introduced as an alternate form of imaging, which does not use ionizing radiation yet can provide detailed structure of the body. Functional MRI (fMRI) has a different application from traditional MRI. It can be used to measure oxygen consumption (tissue metabolic rate), and is an important tool in deciphering brain function. Third, ultrasound imaging is another imaging technique that can detect motion by translating sound wave reflections into structural images at fast timescale. Finally, examples of nuclear imaging and advances in light microscopy are discussed."
93,"Professor Saltzman gives an example of drug administration in the context of biomolecular engineering, and describes how intravenous drug delivery systems deliver different nutrients from different parts of the body. Professor Saltzman then describes the major goal of delivering drug to the home: reducing toxic waste. He then describes ways in which chemotherapy is used to deliver vaccine to the affected areas. The concept of active transport is introduced along with the pharmacokinetic and anti-Hepatitis A reemergence of cytotoxic T cells (T cells), followed by a regulation process to control secretion of toxic waste into the blood.","Professor Saltzman starts the lecture with an introduction to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Professor Saltzman talks about the concept of dose-response. He introduces different routes of drug administration and how they affect drug distribution and bioavailability (i.e., intravenous, oral, and sublingual routes). First-pass drug metabolism by the liver is also identified as an important source of drug degradation. Finally, modeling the body as a well-stirred vessel, Professor Saltzman explains the first-order rate equation: C = (/)*, that can be used calculate the amount of drug in the body (M) as a function of time () and a rate constant (); and the equation for drug half-life:Â Â = ln(/)."
94,"Professorâs definition of an image is broadened to include other technologies as well as new forms of imaging. Professor Saltzman describes the limitations of one type of imaging: X-ray and wave function. The challenges involved in creating an image that is comparable or smaller than the wavelength used in standard medical imaging. The lecture then describes the different modes of imaging (two primary types of memory cells and one per level of memory cell) and how each wave trace corresponds to the events caused by depolarization/repolarization of gases in the blood. Finally, the question of how radionuclides are used in biomedical imaging is addressed.","Professor Saltzman first reviews the electromagnetic spectrum, the different regimes of the spectrum, their respective wavelengths, energies, and ways of detecting them. He then talks about the use of high energy radio waves for imaging of the body. The history, components, advantages and limitations of X-ray imaging are presented in detail. Next, he introduces Computed Tomography, a related imaging technique which uses mathematical computation to compile line-scanned X-rays into a three dimensional image. Finally, Professor Saltzman touches on harmful effects of X-ray radiation, and ways to limit or avoid overexposure in these imaging techniques."
95,"Professor is the first of a series of lectures on DNA technology, and the first step in the biosynthesis of DNA. Molecular genetic engineering allows us to detect mutations in genomic DNA, such as in sickle cell anemia patients who have been denied adequate treatment. The second half of the lecture describes the basic elements of DNA technology: the structure of the molecule, the function of the mitochondria and the mode of transport in cells.","Professor Saltzman introduces the elements of molecular structure of DNA such as backbone, base composition, base pairing, and directionality of nucleic acids. He describes the processes of DNA synthesis, transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational processing required to make a protein such as insulin from its genetic code (DNA). Professor Saltzman describes the genetic code. RNA interference is also discussed as a way to control gene expression, which can be applied as a new way to treat diseases."
96,"Professor the first of two lectures on death, Professor Kagan introduces the concept of âthe soul.â½� The second half of the lecture deals with the question of why we are not familiar with death. A number of philosophical positions are occupied while we wait for our turn to face the facts about our mortality. The professor then turns to a discussion of the different types of thinking: the badness of the human condition, the abnormal selection process, and the fact that we are vulnerable to what may be considered to be an immaterial being. Finally, the question is raised as to whether it is appropriate to consider ourselves in the past when we are dead.",Professor Kagan introduces the course and the material that will be covered during the semester. He aims to clarify what the class will focus on in particular and which subjects it will steer away from. The emphasis will be placed on philosophical questions that arise when one contemplates the nature of death. The first half of the course will address metaphysical questions while the second half will focus on value theory.
97,"The is the first of a series of lectures on the question of why we are not -functioning as a person. The second half of the lecture turns to a discussion of the different ways in which death is experienced. What is it to be dead? A question is then posed about how one should distinguish between the good and the evil. Finally, a number of historical facts concerning our mortality are expounded upon.","The lecture explores the question of the state of being dead. Even though the most logical claim seems to be that when a person stops P-functioning he or she is dead, a more careful consideration must allow for exceptions, such as when one is asleep or in a coma. Professor Kagan then suggests that on some level nobody believes that he or she is going to die. As a case in point, he takes Tolstoyâs famous character Ivan Ilych."
98,"The lecture explores the question of how one should live in the present moment. A discussion is made of two aspects of the question: whether it is rational to live forever under the right circumstances, and what is a right thing to do. A question is then posed about why we are not allowed to choose our mortality. Finally, a question is raised concerning the nature of the human condition.","This is the first of a series of lectures on suicide. Two very distinct contexts are presented in which the subject can be further explored. The first is rationality and the question of under what circumstances it makes sense to end oneâs own life. The second is morality and the question of whether we can ever ethically justify resorting to suicide. The lectureâs focus is on the rational requirements of suicide, and Professor Kagan introduces a number of cases which demonstrate that ending oneâs life, in certain instances, may be rationally sound."
99,"The lecture begins with a discussion of the question, âwhat is it to die?â½�. Then, Professor Kagan turns to the question of why we should be concerned with death. Would it be appropriate to live forever, and if so, under what circumstances one might enjoy such a prolonged existence? Finally, does it seem that we are not close to reaching a moment of transcendence? The answer to such questions is no. What is it about our mortality that has this effect on us? In the remainder of the lecture, he comments on some of the â§�undesirable aspects of death that makes us more vulnerable to what may occur when we are dead.","In this lecture, Professor Kagan invites students to pose the question of how one should live life knowing that it will certainly end in death. He also explores the issue of how we should set our goals and how we should go about achieving them, bearing in mind the time constraints. Other questions raised are how this ultimately affects the quality of our work and our accomplishments, as well as how we decide what is worth doing in life."
100,"The lecture deals primarily with one argument for the immortality of the soul from PlatoâsÂ, namely, â½�the argument from the invisible eyeball.âV, VI, IX and XXV. Plato argues that in order for something to be destroyed, it must have parts, that is, it has to be possible to destroy it. The soul is then discussed in light of the fact that no merely physical entity could go extinct without a fight. Finally, Plato intimates that the soul is non-physical and thus cannot be destroyed by an organism.","Professor Kagan elaborates on the âargument from simplicityâ and discusses in detail Platoâs claims that the soul is simple, changeless and therefore indestructible. The final Platonic argument under discussion is the âargument from essential propertiesâ in which the essential properties of the soul are addressed. At the end of the lecture the question of whether one needs to argue for physicalism is posed."
101,"Professor lecture opens with a discussion of the dualist view of the soul. According to this view, a person is a body and a soul. The dualist views also argues that a person has a certain set of abilities, but a soul is just a body. This distinction is inaccurate because a person cannot fulfill the functions that an organism requires in order to function.","The lecture focuses on arguments that might be offered as proof for the existence of the soul. The first series of arguments discussed is those known as âinferences to the best explanation.â That is, we posit the existence of things we cannot see so as to explain something else that is generally agreed to take place."
102,"The discussion of free will continues but this time the emphasis is placed on the argument that we need to believe in the existence of an immaterial soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will. The lecture then turns to a consideration of some more philosophical premises, such as the idea that we are not merely physical objects but are subject to determinism. These arguments are followed by an objection to the physicalists: since no merely physical entity could have free will, there must be more to us than just being an object of abstract will. Finally, the question of how we know from what we know is addressed.","Professor Kagan discusses in detail the argument of free will as proof for the existence of an immaterial soul. The argument consists of three premises: 1) We have free will. 2) Nothing subject to determinism has free will. 3) All purely physical systems are subject to determinism. The conclusion drawn from this is that humans are not a purely physical system; but Professor Kagan explains why this argument is not truly compelling. In addition, near-death experiences and the Cartesian argument are discussed at length."
103,"The discussion of punishment continues but this time the focus is on the question of how it is used. Traditional theories of punishment are presented, including an account of the desegregation of the moral system in a variety of cases. In the second part of the lecture, Professor Gendler introduces Platoâs first formulation of the categorical imperative and two substantive formulations of it: On the one hand, it is permissible to cultivate a certain degree of happiness; on the other hand, this may require a different level of commitment. The problem of reconciling is explored in light of several consequentialist theories. The first is that, in some cases, the moral luck of the victim is itself predicated on an appeal to the divine power of the imagination. The second is that the moral law of the community is not enough to punish the person for his actions. The third is that society is not intrinsically bad; it is just a place where the incentives of the wicked are mixed up.","In the opening part of the lecture, Professor Gendler concludes her discussion of punishment by exploring how Alan Kazdinâs research on effective parenting provides insights about techniques for rehabilitating individuals who violate societal norms. She then moves to the third large unit of the course: the question of the legitimacy and structure of the state. One answer to the question of state legitimacyâthat of Thomas Hobbesâis presented. Hobbes argues that life without a government, in a âstate of nature,â would be ânasty, poor, solitary, brutish, and shortâ as a result of violent competition for resources. To avoid this situation, Â Hobbes contends that rational individuals should lay down some of their rights in order to receive the benefits of a centralized state, to the extent that others are also willing to do so."
104,"This this first of three lectures, Professor Paul Fry explores the courseâs requirements and requirements. He begins with an introduction to Philosophy and then introduces the discipline of deontology, which according to which the professor will explore issues of free will or the mind-body problem. The professor then moves to substantive consideration of some of the central questions raised over the course of the semester, such as the legitimacy of the state, justice, equality, and the nature of the human condition. He goes on to discuss a number of substantive topics in the course, including the different types of evidence presented in each.","Professor Gendler explains the interdisciplinary nature of the course: work from philosophy, psychology, behavioral economics, and literature will be brought to bear on the topic of human nature. The three main topics of the course are introducedâhappiness and flourishing, morality, and political philosophyâand examples of some of the courseâs future topics are discussed."
105,"The Trolley Bystander case is an example of how political philosophy can be used to cultivate a certain kind of harmony. In the context of the crisis of 2007-09, the government was reluctant to allow an âidle-virgin soilâ from a certain point of view. When it comes to moral responsibility, however, there are several principles that can be construed as permissible and perhaps even complicit in maintaining a certain level of tension. The second half of the lecture focuses on human beings as individuals and the ways in which they can achieve a certain degree of peace. A third half of this lecture addresses the problem of â§§±, in which individuals are forced to confront the consequences of their actions. The first half of each lecture looks at two cases: the story of the rock climber who is stuck at the bottom of the crevasse; and the book of J.J. Salinger. An examination of some of the central themes raised by the first part of the semester: the idea of social justice is not an idealized notion; rather, it is a necessary step in the development of a shared community.","Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of differing responses to hypothetical and actual examples, and offers an actual example of a Trolley Problem. Then, the central topic of the lecture, punishment, is presented. After offering a characterization of what civil punishment involves, Professor Gendler discusses various justifications that have been offered of the practice. She distinguishes between justifications that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking, and between justifications that are primarily victim-directed and those that are primarily offender-directed. These outlooks are then connected to the moral views that have been presented in earlier lectures: Utilitarianism and deontology"
106,"The Gendler begins in the context of Aristotleâs ethics, in which gravity is a law that tells you how things ought to behave. Becoming virtuous, by accepting the consequences of our actions, we cultivate virtue in some way. A similar theme is found in an essay by Ursula Le Guinard, where the author urges the gentiles to cultivate virtue by cultivating in themselves certain sorts of habits.","We become virtuous by acting as if we are virtuous. This central insight of Aristotle is explored in this lecture. Professor Gendler begins by explaining how Aristotleâs method can allow us to turn normative lawsâwhich describe how we actâinto descriptive lawsâwhich describe how we act. But what practical strategies are available to help us turn our reflective behavior (acting as if virtuous) into automatic behavior (being virtuous)? To address this question, Professor Gendler explores a number of surprising parallels between Pavlovian conditioning of animals, successful parenting strategies, and techniques for acquiring virtue by habit."
107,"Sexating in the 1970s, the sex ratios of males and females in the population is very important. Females often prefer males to have a smaller number of children than they would prefer to have. In some cases, this leads to an increase in male fertility. But in other cases, the ratio is much lower. There is a difference in the rates of births. In places where contraception is not used, the rate of child bearing is higher. The only good news is that the changes in rates do not affect demographic trends.","In East and South Asia there are many more boys than girls. Previously, this resulted from female infanticide, now it is sex-selective abortion. In those cultures, girls generally marry out of the family as teenagers and thus provide no benefit for the family that raised them. Bangladesh is agriculturally very rich, but its population is so dense that per capita income is one of the lowest in Asia. Despite the poverty, an excellent family planning program has greatly reduced fertility."
108,"Theâs problems with population were not limited to the French; rather, the books of Napoleon III and later John Stuart Mill contributed to an even greater number of Americans. The books of the last class surveyed show how Napoleon was able to manage his empire while the British ignored the consequences of his own actions. One of the major challenges faced by Europe in the wake of the Revolution was that its rulers were unable to effectively manage the demands of their new settlers. On the other hand, the book of James Joyce presents many of the features of the nineteenth-century American frontier reformulated to encompass New England and the rest of the colonies.","Prior to Malthus, population growth was seen as good for the power and wealth of a country. The rapid population growth of America was crucial in expelling England (via the Revolution) and France (via the Louisiana Purchase) from the US. But in fact, the numbers of the poor were growing in Europe in the 1700s. Malthus argued that poverty was due to an imbalance between people and resources; since population could rise very fast, it could always outstrip any gains in productivity. He did not anticipate an exponential increase in production or a voluntary decrease in fertility. However, Malthusâ thinking is still important because high population levels and environmental limitations are in fact problematic today. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mortality was falling in Europe and this caused a population explosion. The productivity gains of the Industrial Revolution were nearly balanced by the increased population; per capita income of the working classes was not much improved. Fertility didnât drop until late in the nineteenth century; per capita income started to grow rapidly. The reason for the fertility decline is not well explained by declining mortality or rising standard of living or any other socioeconomic factor. The mortality and later fertility drop is called the"
109,"The prehistoric world had so many hunters, it opened the door to an infinite number of new food and other resources. This allowed us to examine the evolutionary basis for this upsurge, from the idea of the hunt to the story of the emergence of the anticyclones in the ocean. We discuss the difference between hunter-gatherers and hunters, and how the difference in species can tell us a lot about how different species tend to evolve over time. Finally, we discuss how diversity changes in the population can influence human behavior.","Hunter-gatherer populations were much less dense than later agriculturalists. The variety of their food supply protected them from crop failures and their sparseness reduced the spread of infectious diseases. Hunter-gatherers were healthier and worked less than early agriculturalists. Why didnât their numbers increase up to the same level of Malthusian misery? Their numbers may have been limited by violence between groups. Agriculture is more work intense and offers a less varied diet. Populations seem to grow rapidly and then die out suddenly. Populations are subject to climatic- or disease-caused crop failure. But farming allows individuals to produce a surplus of food that can then be stolen by warrior tribes or military castes. The surplus allows for population growth, cities and stratified societies. The death rate, until perhaps the 1700s in Europe, is enormously high: only approximately a third of women survive to the end of their reproductive period. At this death rate, surviving women who are able to reproduce must have more than six children on average or the society goes extinct. All the great religions and cultures develop in this long period and all stress the requirement for high reproductive rates: âBe fruitful"
110,"Sexualroduction is not simple or easy, nor is it fair. Females often prefer males to have the same number of children as they would prefer to have. In some situations, this can lead to an extremely negative effect on the quality of children. In other cases, the negative effect is a loss of educational opportunities. To counteract this, the young women must engage in a competition among themselves to get a good education.","Chimpanzee males compete for position in a dominance hierarchy; status often depends on support from other members, including females, of the group. High-ranking males have much greater sexual access to females in estrus. Males control females by physical violence and intimidation. Chimpanzees also engage in purposeful raids to kill members of other chimpanzee groups. This inter-group violence can help explain intra-group violence. To fend off attack from other groups, males must remain in groups and that requires males to compete for mating opportunities within the community. Competition for the scarce resource, eggs, leads to male-male violence and male coercion of females. If the alpha male monopolized all reproductive potential, then evolution would push non-dominant males to either fight continually for dominance or to leave the group and find females elsewhere. The chimpanzee solution is to allow all males some, though very unequal, reproductive possibility."
111,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by showing how Faulkner expands our understanding of the Civil War from the perspectives of the ancestors to the present. She argues that the novel borrows narrative techniques from film, particularly flashback, to show how the inter-ethnic conflict between the whites and the blacks is neutralized by the supernatural elements of the novelâs narrative, such as the smell of death emanating from the old women in the forest. Dimock draws a contrast between the racial dichotomy presented in the first section of and the racial one represented in the second section, which is narrated by Jason Williams. The nature of the difference between justice and goodness is explored with reference to Jasonâ�Ainslieâ=Leda and Roy Sorensenâ.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of by juxtaposing Quentinâs stream-of-consciousness to his brother Benjyâs narrative subjectivity. Professor Dimock argues that Faulkner uses stylistic parallels between the two sections to communicate âkinshipâ and âvariationâ between the two narrators. In her readings, she focuses on their relationship with the black characters in, as well as their reactions to Caddyâs loss of sexual innocence. She concludes with a discussion of Quentinâs suicide as a reaction to the âsecond-hand tragedyâ of Caddyâs pregnancy."
112,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of Hemingwayâs World War II by using three analytical scales: the map of the world, the story of the Moors, and the narrative of the Spanish Civil War. She argues that Hemingfordâ was perhaps best known for his innovative use of maps to describe the political events of the war. She then turns to a discussion of the origins of the modernist novel in the context of New England literature, with reference to examples from the American colonies. She draws a contrast between the fiction of the English Civil War and the novels of Aeneas and Borges. She concludes by reading the novel as a utopia, presenting a narrative of dispossession and human agency.","Professor Dimock introduces the class to the works of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner, the premiere writers of American modernism. She orients their novels along three âscalesâ of interpretation: global geopolitics, experimental narration, and sensory detail. Invoking the writings of critic Paul Fussell, she argues that all three writers are united by a preoccupation with World War I and the implications that the Great War has for irony in narrative representation."
113,"In this second lecture on, Professor Donald Kagan traces the genealogy behind the title of theÂ. He shows how, in the context of the Trojan War, there is a clear connection between the ideal world and the ideal man: Agamemnonâs love always mediated by other characters. Then he moves on to the larger, unknowable entities: the House of the Bundrens, the mythical figure of Odysseus (Â Â II), the house of the Papyri (Â III), and the mythological figures of Homer (Â IV). The story of Pyramus and GrisÃ³ concludes with the tragic downfall of Don Quixote, which seems to point to the emergence of an ideal man from the pit of Hell. Finally, Professor Kagan touches on the tragic dimensions of Donquixoteâsâ as depicted in the bullfighter Finochesus.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock begins her discussion of Faulknerâs by orienting the novel to the Great Depression in the South, as focalized through such famous texts as. Once this macro history is established, she reads the narrative techniques of through two analytic lenses. First, she draws on Bakhtinâs notion of social dialects to underscore the language that indexes poor whites as a Southern type. Second, she marshals Frank Kermodeâs idea of narrative secrecy to show how two secrets in Dewey Dellâs illegitimate pregnancy and Jewelâs illegitimate birthâare gradually revealed to the reader through Faulknerâs multiple narrators, each a speaker of a socially codified dialect, and each a practitioner of narrative secrecy in his or her own right."
114,"Professor this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the epic conventions ofÂ. He begins with an account of the journey of Odysseus from Book XI to Phyle, where the poet passes from the good to the evil. The badness of this revelation is dramatized in the episode of Clovis, where Clovin becomes enamored of the pilgrim, only to be repelled by the smell of death emanating from the old women in the forest. Finally, Professor Fry examines the contrast between the human and non-human as depicted in DanteâsÂ Â (Â II).Â In the final segment of the lecture, the moral dilemmas ofÂ Ã§a are explored with reference to the mythological figures of Homer and Ephesus.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock traces Faulknerâs appropriation of the epic genre through two conventions: the blurring of boundaries between humans and non-humans and the resurrection of the dead. She first reads Faulknerâs minor character Tull and his relation to both mules and buzzards to draw out the ânature of manhood in poor whites.â From Tull, she shifts focus to Jewel and suggests that his kinship with the snake and the horse foregrounds the narrative secrecy of Jewelâs genealogy. As Addie Bundrenâs monologue reveals, Jewelâs illegitimate father, the Reverend Whitfield, is similarly identified with both the horse, as the animal he rides, and the snake, whose Edenic behavior he parallels in his affair with Addie."
115,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by showing how Faulkner borrows and adapts themes from other authors in the novel, bringing together elements from different backgrounds, such as the fauns and satyrs. The idea of the metamorphosis of the soul is explored in connection with the nineteenth-century novelâs mythology of the Siren in the background. The natural selection of omepheres, or topography, in the mix is considered in relation to that of the modern author, John Stuart Mill. Professor Dimock reads the episode as a representation of the dualism we take for granted in the picaresque novel: the first episodes ofÂ, which consist of an interlude between the physical world and the spiritual world, and the moral dilemmas of the episode which leads us to ask what makes us happy?","Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses her introductory lecture on Faulknerâs on the âpagan qualityâ of his protagonist Lena. She argues that Faulkner uses Lena to update the classic story of the unwed mother by fusing comedy with the epic road novel. In doing so, he also updates the Greek tradition of the kindness of strangers, drawing attention to it through certain stylistic markers, including the âswitchabilityâ between the protagonist and her supporting cast, the use of gerunds as a linguistic safe haven for Lena, and the allegorical naming of Byron and Burden as social types with scripted trajectories."
116,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of by examining what it means to be black. She uses the word âniggerâ½� to refer to Joe Christmasâs. She then turns to the broader cultural context of the term, using examples from the sixties and seventeenth-century novels. The semantic burden of this word is tied to the African American experience. In the second portion of the lecture, she shows how the word is used to denote both a different person as well as a different attribute: the imagination. Dimock argues that the word varies in meaning due to the different perspectives of different people on the same topic.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of and the semester by mapping Faulknerâs theology of Calvinist predestination onto race. Using Nella Larsenâs novel as an intertext, she shows how Joe Christmasâs decision to self-blacken expresses his tragic sense of being predestined, of always âcoming second.â Moving away from tragedy, Dimock reads Hightowerâs delivery of Lenaâs baby as inhabiting a liminal space between tragedy and comedy, as Faulkner gives Hightower a second chance at meaningful communal agency. Â She finishes by reading Lena Grove and Byron Bunchâs courtship as the comic end of."
117,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by highlighting the importance of the epic tradition to the modernist novel. She shows how the author vacillates between âthe good and the evil,â½� and Î±, the ugly and the ugly. Through a close reading of the novel, she shows Faulkner acknowledging the fine line between prophecy and profanation, but then showing how the story draws parallels between what is normally the case with the picaresque novel of the same genre, such as the caging of the duke and duchess. Dimmesdale also shows that the real challenge in narrative is to recuperate the moral ambivalence which appears to be present in the adulterous affair.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of with an analysis of its generic form. Using Nathaniel Hawthorneâs to anchor her discussion of the American literary tradition, she argues that continually negotiates the comic and the tragic genres as we shift from one perspective to another: one characterâs comic gain is often anotherâs tragic loss. She traces the losses and gains of Cash, Jewel, and Darl throughout the novel, showing how their new âbalancesâ by the end reconstitute the Bundren family and draw lines of kinship around the âhavesâ and âhave notsâ among family members."
118,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of Fitzgeraldâs career as a Hollywood screenwriter. She shows how the novel borrows narrative techniques from film, particularly flashback, to show how characters evolve into different types of characters. Invoking the theories of Sergei Eisenstein, she reads scenes of wartime inter-ethnic conflict between the rich and the poor as a harbinger of the modern condition: an instance of racial differentiation is heard as a precursor to the real-world scenario of World War I. She also shows how language is used to depict the tragicomic dimensions of wartime death that we take for granted.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock demonstrates how four of Fitzgeraldâs most famous short storiesââThe Rich Boy,â âBabylon Revisited,â âThe Diamond as Big as the Ritz,â and âBernice Bobs Her Hairâârepresent âsocial types,â generic identities that Fitzgerald explores as forms of social reality. Â She reads the dramatic tension in each of those stories as determined by the protagaonistâs conformity to or deviation from their idealized social type."
119,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by asking why Caddyâs narrative choice was made. She argues that because the novel is essentially a collection of stories, and because the main focus is on the individual voice, it is unclear to what extent the whole network is a one-dimensional omniscient narration. She then turns to the discussion of Caddy as the narrator in section four of. The conversation between the priest and the canon is then explored with reference to the famous caddy episode ofÂ, from the first section of to the second section of. Dimock explores the distinction Faulkner draws between Caddy and Don Quixote, who ironically gets trapped in the third section by his own voice. She ends by suggesting that the only good way for Caddy to escape the world is by acting as if he were the only one who could have prevented this from happening.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock closes her reading of by reading section fourâthe section related by an omniscient narratorâthrough Luster and Dilsey, the two black characters whose personal and racial histories are woven into the history of the Compson family. Luster and Dilseyâs centrality to the final section of the novel, particularly their interactions with the Reverent Shegog on Easter Sunday, transform into a story of redemption; they reconstitute a sense of community whose loss is mourned in Jasonâs section. Professor Dimock concludes by reading the final scene of section fourâJasonâs taking over of the horse Queenie from Lusterâs controlâas Jasonâs brief and heroic redemption, the only respite that Faulkner grants Jason in the course of the novel."
120,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by reading the novel as a representation of Hemingwayâs argument on the nature of death. She argues that the Real part of the novel is represented in the depiction of the disempowerment of the Fascists, who are determined to destroy the republic and establish their political legitimacy. She also shows how Donne can be used as a propaganda tool to distract attention from his own political commitments. In the final segment of the lecture, she shows how Hemingford draws parallels between the political orientations of the American citizenry and the fascist revolutionaries in the novel, as well as the frightening realities of trench warfare.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock begins her discussion of Hemingwayâs with an overview of the Spanish Civil War, the historical event at the heart of the novel. She introduces the notion of an âinvoluntary foreignerâ to discuss the fate of Hemingwayâs American protagonist Robert Jordan, as well as the Spanish guerillas who are turned into âaliensâ within their own country due to their print and technological illiteracies. Professor Dimock concludes by connecting oneâs status as an involuntary foreigner to the shape of the future, arguing that these characters have a tenuous claim to a Spain dominated by the Fascists, and to a modernity increasingly dominated by technology."
121,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of Hemingwayâs by reading the novel as a â½-hour narrative of dispossession. She shows how Hemingford borrows and adapts themes from other writers to show how Hemmalkâ is a layered process, presenting a wide variety of possibilities. Drawing on several examples from the American West, she reads scenes of wartime inter-ethnic conflict in the. She shows that Heminggil draws parallels between his own experiences as a prisoner of war and the modern author J. D. Salinger, in particular, moves from one historiosophy to another, showing how the tension between the dual narratives ofÂ Â and, she reads the episode as a harbinger of the modern condition: a threatening world in which strangers reign supreme.","Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of Hemingwayâs, testing four additional clusters of chapters and vignettes. She offers readings of each cluster that focus on Hemingwayâs logics of expressivity, substitution, and emotional resilience. She concludes that Hemingway mixes tragedy and comedy as genres of writing to produce a humor that vacillates between irony and farce."
122,"Theâs invasion of New York City in 1968 contributed to a wide-ranging political and intellectual upsurge. One of the central questions concerning 1968 was why did this new generation come to New York? This question, posed in an essay by Paul Brousse, is up for debate. On one hand, the militancy seen in New York as an attempt to justify the rightness of liberals to have been denied effective treatment. On the other hand, it was a moment of social protest, such as the desegregation of the Armed Forces, that resulted in the first full-scale mobilization of the French army.","The student protests of May 1968 in France were linked to international protests against the American war in Vietnam and other political and social consequences of the Cold War. In many respects, the terrible condition of many schools in France that led students to revolt remains a problem. Recent attempts to impose American-style reforms on the university system have met with protests that echo some of the demands made in â68; although, other conditions for revolution seem as though they may never again be realized in the same way."
123,"Professorâs political orientations are formed by the competing claims of liberals, socialists, and some Bolsheviks in particular. Although morale is normally high in these cities, this is the first of a series of lectures on the politics of France. The topics covered include national identity, the role of the opposition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the relationship between communist revolutionaries and socialist reformers, the effects of economic crisis and amour-propre, and the relation between nationalism and xenophobia.","Anti-Americanism in France has historically been directed toward the U.S. government and corporations rather than American citizens. In the wake of World War II, the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe was considered by many to be a form of American imperialism. Along with the establishment of American military bases on French soil, the years after World War II bore witness to a great influx of American products, notably refrigerators and Coca-Cola. French concern over American cultural imports persists today, and has extended to include policies aimed at keeping the French language free of English words."
124,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses the history of England and Scotland in the post-Roman period. He argues that the major advantage of the British Empire was its proximity to the English cities of London and Glasgow; the presence of a relatively large Irish contingent, coupled with the local activism of nationalist groups, made the Empire an army of brickbats. Finally, he touches on the significance of the local custom of the early sixteenth century, which regulated the practice of speaking in tongues. He ends by describing the manner in which these local acts of resistance were interpreted to minimize the danger of religious conflict.","In this lecture, Professor Freedman considers the importance of the British Isles in the early Middle Ages, both in their own right and as an example of a post-Roman frontier society. In the wake of the fifth century Roman withdrawal, England experienced âradical economic simplification.â However, Englandâs conversion to Christianity beginning at the end of the sixth century brought about a flourishing written culture and Latin learning. Ireland experienced a similar cultural flowering, although it had converted to Christianity centuries earlier. It had never been colonized by the Romans, and the Irish Church was less hierarchical, more decentralized, and placed less importance on bishops than did the Roman. The conversion of England under the competeing influences of Rome and ireland was thus not just a conflict between Christianity and paganism, but also between two administrative styles of Christianity. Professor Freedman ends the lecture with a few remarks on the cultural accomplishments of the British Isles."
125,"The this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the relationship between land and water in the Arabian world. Different geographersâ maps of the same time are discussed, including an account of the odyssey of Ptolemy who leads the Arab world into the Heavenly Jerusalem. The book of Aeneas is a classic example of this point of view, and the book of Habbakuk describes the emergence of new forms of literary expression within the Muslim world. It also shows the contribution of mathematics to the study of history, with the Arabs embarking on large-scale excavations in the Mediterranean world.","In the first half of this lecture,Professor Freedman continues the previous lectureâs discussion of the Abbasids. He highlights their ability to assimilate other cultures, before turning to their decline in the tenth century. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Freedman considers the seventh century, the crucial turning point in the history of early medieval Europe. The seventh century shaped medieval Europe; the period saw the rise of Islam and Northern Europe, fundamental changes in Byzantium, the reorientation of Persia, and the end of the secular elite in the west. Professor Freedman concludes with a few remarks on the Pirenne thesis, which states that the rise of Islam broke up the Mediterranean and paved the way for the rise of northern Europe."
126,"Theâs first lecture is about the origins of World War I. It includes both standard historical texts and films, and sets the stage for the atrocities of the war. The second half of the lecture focuses on the three mutinies that took place in the trenches during World War II. The mutinie began as a protest against the new partition of the Roman Empire, but quickly escalated when the Germans discovered that Byzantium and Persia were too weak to withstand their assault. This protest would continue until the end of hostilities.","If the early years of the twentieth century were marked by a general consensus that a major war was impending, no similar consensus existed concerning the likely form that war would take. Not only the carnage of World War I, but also the nature of its alliances would have been difficult to imagine. Indeed, in 1900 many people would have predicted conflict, rather than collaboration, between France and Britain. The reasons for the eventual entente between France and Britain and France and Russia consist principally in economic and geopolitical motivations. Cultural identity also played a role, particularly in relations between France and Germany. The territory of Alsace-Lorraine formed a crucible for the questions of nationalism and imaginary identity that would be contested in the Great War."
127,"The this lecture, Professor Kagan traces the expansion of Russian empire from its beginnings in the 1230s to the Russian Civil War in 1679-80. The Russian empire was able to expand further into the Mediterranean Sea and into the Caspian Sea. In the wake of this expansion, the Russian czars sought to establish their political legitimacy in order to legitimate their claims of independence. However, these efforts were unable to secure the support of the Soviet army, which would later fall victim to the ethnic nationalism of the Muslims. Finally, through an analysis of the historical documents of this era, Professor Mikhail Kagan intimates that the Russian empire will eventually turn into a functional republic.","Peter the Greatâs historical significance stems not only from his military ambitions and the great expansion of the Russian Empire under his supervision, but also from his efforts to introduce secular, Western customs and ideas into Russian culture. Despite his notorious personal brutality, Peterâs enthusiasm for science and modern intellectual concerns made an indelible mark both on Russiaâs relationship to the West and on its internal politics. The struggle under Peterâs reign between Westernizers and Slavophiles, or those who resist foreign influences, can be seen at work in Russia up to the present day."
128,"The Enlightenment was an important moment in Franceâs history, because it helped pave the way for the emergence of a new republic. It also gave an important example of the â½�great men,â the idle upper classes who were forced to carry on the work of farming while the latter trained for war. The Enlightenment also pioneered the first democratic political program, the progressive measures that French workers enjoy today. These measures resulted in the polarization and politicization of affairs, such as the curtailment of municipal privileges.","While the major philosophical projects of the Enlightenment are associated with the names of individual thinkers such as Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, the cultural transformation in France in the years leading up to the Revolution should also be understood in the context of the public sphere and popular press. Alongside such luminaries as those associated with DiderotâsÂ Â were a host of lesser pamphleteers and libellists eager for fame and some degree of fortune. If the writings of this latter group were typically vulgar and bereft of literary merit, they nonetheless contributed to the âdesacralizationâ of monarchy in the eyes of the growing literate public. Lawyersâ briefs, scandal sheets and pornographic novels all played a role in robbing the monarchy of its claim to sacred authority at the same time as they helped advance the critique of despotism that would serve as a major impetus for the Revolution."
129,"Professor nineteenth-century medical debate in the medical community was at the center of a series of debates, most famously associated with contagionism and anticontagionism. One of the central questions raised by these debates concerned the relationship between truth and history. While the origins of the disease are well documented, there are also many unresolved problems. Over the course of the century, the distinction between âwhat is it to be knownâ and â½, the two maladies emerged. Along with the long-term debate over what constitutes an epidemic, the second half of the nineteenth century was occupied by the controversies over contagionist and anticogionism, with particular emphasis placed on the latter concern of mortality.","The debate between contagionists and anticontagionists over the transmission of infectious diseases played a major role in nineteenth-century medical discourse. On the one side were those who believed that diseases could be spread by infected material, perhaps including people and inanimate objects, and on the other those who subscribed to the more venerable miasmatic theory. Although the contagionist view would be substantially vindicated by Robert Kochâs germ theory of disease, it is important not to simply ignore the arguments put forward by the anticontagionists. Although these were based on science that has since been disproven, the concrete proposals put forward by scientists like Max von Pettenkofer marked a major step forward for public health policy. In particular, the anticontagionistsâ emphasis on the environmental factors of disease control continues to provide an important lesson."
130,"The is not an ideal world for AIDS, and the U.S. has a population of about 3.3 billion. In developing countries, the disease is experienced very differently. While in developed countries, there are many different forms of prevention, the MMWR is the most pervasively important. It is not unique among the great pandemic of the past, nor is it unique in its demographic effects. The public health response to the disease has been largely ignored, so the devastation wrought by the 2002-2008 epidemic is unprecedented. One of the major ways in which the public health responses have been to the epidemic was through the mobilization of biologists and epidemiologists.","Dr. Margaret Craven discusses HIV/AIDS from the perspective of a front-line clinician. AIDS is unprecedented in both the speed with which it spread across the globe and in the mobilization of efforts to control it. It is a disease of modernity. Along with the relative ease and velocity of modern transportation methods, other background conditions include Western medicine, with hypodermic needles and bloodbanking, intravenous drug use, and the development and concentration of gay culture. In the U.S., early public health attempts at understanding and combating the virus were hindered by right-wing domestic political and religious forces. Successful containment of epidemics cannot be achieved under the spell of hypocrisy and politicization; rather, medicine and education must be evidence-based and practical."
131,"The ancient world was at the center of a series of economic crises, such as floods and volcanic eruptions. One of the most important public health strategies was malariaâs response to these problems: sanariology, quarantines, and isolation. Although these strategies have been successful, they are in some respects complicit in defeating the disease. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Wargo discusses the different strategies deployed against malaria. While the early years of the 21 century faced a high-risk population, the mid-twentieth-century epidemic resulted in the first full-scale public health program, the work of scientists and epidemiologists began to seriously consider the role of malaria in the development of modern diseases.","In the last decade of the nineteenth century, malariology emerged as the most prestigious and intellectually exciting field in the new discipline of tropical medicine. The diseaseâs complexity and resistance to conventional public health strategies posed a major challenge to doctors and scientists. Plague measures and social hygiene had no effect in curbing malaria, and the disease proved difficult to classify. The case of Italy, and the malaria eradication program of 1900-1962, furnished a model for other efforts across the world. In evaluating the Italian campaign, it is important to distinguish between valuable lessons and warnings for future efforts, and in particular to account for the diversity of strategies responsible for its success."
132,"Professor Wrightson surveys the transformation of the early Church of England from its beginnings in the twelfth century to the mid-eighteenth century. He notes that the transformation was uneven across the country and involved large numbers of people, the âmiddling sort of Protestantsâ½� who were prepared to leave behind their pre-fallen notions of divine retributive justice. Professor Wrightson then moves on to the reforms enacted under the Act of Uniformity which outlawed the practice of speaking in tongues. The measures taken to combat this trend include the introduction of new forms of repentance, such as the Stags, an illogical form of repentance that raises issues of moral responsibility and concern for the poor. He ends by describing the process by which clerics were able to restore the distinction between church and state through a process of repentance.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson surveys the religious landscape of England during the later medieval period through to the reign of Henry VIII and the beginnings of the reformation. He notes that while the late medieval church was more vibrant and popular than many early triumphal analysis of the reformation allowed for, there were, nonetheless, critics of Catholicism within England. He traces the earlier opposition to the church as arising from three primary groups: those educated clerics and laymen who desired reform within the church, the small pockets of Lollards within England who opposed traditional religion, and the group of people influenced by European reformation thought who would later work to implement doctrinal change within the Church of England. Professor Wrightson also provides an analysis of late medieval piety and the role that the traditional church played in peopleâs daily lives at the local level prior to the reformation."
133,"Professor Wrightson discusses the transformation of the royal government which resulted from the passage of the Fixed Acts in 1649. The Kingâs decision not to allow parliament to hold constitutional conventions in 1659-60 is an important step in the process of restoring the monarchy. In the wake of the controversy over the appointment of Patrick Collinson, the so-called Cavalier Parliament, which was dominated by unscrupulous and criminal Yankees, Charles I was forced to face the consequences stemming from his actions during the war. The events of the first sessions of the Long Parliament are examined with particular attention paid to the role of the Clovis regime, characterized by the curtailment of municipal privileges.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson discusses the Restoration settlement of 1660 and the reigns of Charles II and James II. He highlights the manner in which tensions between the crown and the political nation slowly escalated during Charlesâs reign (as a result of his attempts to grant religious toleration, unpopular wars against the Dutch and diplomatic alliances with France). Charles showed himself to be a shrewd politician and managed to contain these tensions, but the situation became increasingly fraught after the alleged âPopish Plotâ precipitated the Exclusion Crisis of 1679-81 and the emergence of the Whig and Tory parties. Charles faced down the threat to his authority successfully. However, he was succeeded in 1685 by his openly Catholic brother James II, who proved politically inept and unable to build on Charlesâ success. Fears of Jamesâ catholicizing and absolutist intentions erupted in 1688 in the Glorious Revolution, when the Dutch leader William of Orange (husband of Jamesâ daughter Mary) was invited to intervene, leading in Jamesâ flight abroad and the offer of the crown to William and"
134,"Professor Wrightson begins by discussing the manner in which domestic violence was dealt with in both the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He then considers the distinction between urban and rural as well as urban. While urban areas were typically impoverished affairs, these could be enjoyable pursuits for the wealthy, such as watching the sunset of a leisurely leisure session. Finally, Professor Wrightson explores the relationship between gender and violence. The nature of both types of crimes is explored, and the distinction drawn between the high-pitched rhetoric of rape and the misdemeanors perpetrated by the âhotter sortâ½� of women. He examines the rising levels of violence, from the rise of nationalism in the early sixteenth century to the violent backlash provoked by the perceived hygienic problems of enclosure. He considers the exceptionally large scale of these crimes, with the government seemingly concerned over the welfare of the poor, and concludes that the forms of human agency were not limited to the realm of the common man.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson examines the problem of order in early modern society, focusing on crimes of violence and upon property crime. In examining violence, he notes the existence of special cases geographically (the borderlands) and socially (aristocratic violence) before looking at the lower (and gradually declining) levels of homicide in general. He then considers property crime, distinguishing the various categories of theft and the manner in which cases were brought to, and handled in, the courts. The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries witnessed a peak in prosecution, but while the law could be harsh and bloody in meting out punishment, it was also characterized by discretionary extension of mercy. Interpretations of the use of such discretion are compared and assessed â as are the limits that existed on its use in a society that believed in the deterrent effect of âexemplary punishment.â"
135,"Professor Wrightson surveys the changing economic landscape of early seventeenth century England can be said to have experienced a decline in life expectancies and high levels of mortality. He then considers the consequences of this change: urban cleansing took place in an attempt to combat the epidemic of 1665, and resulted in large-scale rebellions. Moral outrage at these developments was voiced by the so-called âKnobe effect,â½� in which the perceived hygienic problems of concentrated populations were aggravated by what Professor Wrightson termed a â§�monarchical sort of discontent. One of the ways in which both types of discontent resulted from the rise of new forms of discontent is reflected upon: the emergence of new kinds of discontent, such as the effects of poverty on working people. Finally, the problems of enclosure are addressed and the government is able to make strides in stabilizing the situation.","Professor Wrightson discusses the remarkable growth of the British economy in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He examines the changed context of stable population and prices; regional agricultural specialization; urbanization; the expansion of overseas trade both with traditional European trading partners and with the Americas and the East; the growth of manufacturing industries which served both domestic and overseas markets, and the intensification of internal trade. He describes and explains the emergence of an increasingly closely articulated national market economy, closely linked to a nascent world economy in which Britain now played a core role."
136,"Professor Wrightson surveys the developments of the English war. He notes that the events of the first sessions of the New Model Army and the manner in which King Charlesâs demands were countered and defeated. Professor Wrightson then moves on to the substantive part of the war, where the tensions between the various sides are explored. The issues of representation at the meeting of the Commons are addressed, and the composition of both royalist and parliamentarian support is discussed. Finally, the role played by the voices of the so-called ØCalvinist sortââ is considered, with particular attention paid to the rising tensions which led to the conflict over representation. He ends this lecture by describing the developments in parliamentary political engagement which resulted in the passage of the Articles of Settlement.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson considers the events leading to the execution of Charles I in 1649, and the republican regimes of 1649-60 (the Commonwealth and the Protectorate), with particular attention to the role of Oliver Cromwell. He begins with the unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement with Charles I after the civil war, the intervention of the army in 1647 and the outbreak of the second civil war in 1648, which culminated in Prideâs Purge and the trial and execution of Chares I. He then considers Cromwellâs campaigns in 1649-51, his expulsion of the Rump Parliament in 1653, the nominated parliament of 1653 (Bareboneâs Parliament) and the two phases of the Cromwellian Protectorate 1654-8, ending with the instability following Cromwellâs death and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Professor Wrightson notes that although the Restoration marked the failure of the revolution, the political landscape had been irrevocably changed. The restored monarchy lived in the shadow of the civil war, the politicization of a large section of society was not reversed, religious dissent was"
137,"Professor Wrightson begins by discussing the social order in early modern England. He then considers the various social groups, such as the common people, nobles, and craftsmen, who were all involved in aggregating their resources. The issues of reconciling the commonwealth, however, are addressed. Professor Wrightson explores the role of religion in the anxiety aroused by King Henry VIIâs expansion of the Roman Empire. The Christian church is further discussed, with particular attention paid to the benefits of the newly created kingdom, as well as the implications of his intervention in the English political process. Finally, Professor Freeman discusses the manner in which the religious beliefs of the early sixteenth century were explained and discussed.","Professor Wrightson provides a broad sketch of the social order of early modern England, focusing on the hierarchical language of âestatesâ and âdegreesâ and the more communitarian ideal of the âcommonwealthâ by which society was organized. The differences between the social structure in rural and urban areas are addressed and the subordinate roles of women and the young are also outlined. Professor Wrightson discusses the differences between members of peerage, the gentry, and the commonalty and the social positions of servants, yeoman, husbandmen, and apprentices are explained. The mechanisms by which the social order was preserved, such as prescriptive literature and ecclesiastical injunctions, are also considered. Professor Wrightson concludes that, while in the theory the social order was rigidly hierarchical and rooted in relationships of authority and subordination, in practice there was a great more flexibility and ambiguity within every day interpersonal social relationships."
138,"Professor Freeman discusses the developments in British colonial administration after the Boston Massacre of 1770. She shows how the King was able to create an atmosphere of mutual sympathy for the colonists, even if it meant the deaths of one of the central groups. Professor Freeman also discusses the nature of the âagrarian,â½� that is, a minority group of people who were determined to fight against the British invaders. She concludes by suggesting that the violence of the 1770s raised hopes that the British would cease hostilities and allow the colonies to go on to war.","Professor Freeman continues her discussion of the Boston Massacre and how it represented a growing sense of alienation between the American colonists and the British authorities. The Americans and British both felt that the colonies were subordinate to Parliament in some way, but differed in their ideas of the exact nature of the imperial relationship. This period saw the formation of non-importation associations to discourage merchants from importing British goods, as well as committees of correspondence to coordinate resistance. One instance of such resistance occurred in December 1773, when Boston radicals who were frustrated with the Tea Act threw shipments of tea into Boston Harbor."
139,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the logic of British strategy during the Revolution. She argues that the nature of the conflict and the manner in which the British engaged with the colonists helped pave the way for the emergence of a new nation. She also shows how the American colonists underestimated the British in their attempt to negotiate with them on an international level. This element of the strategy is illustrated via a recent book, A Theory of the Warfare.","Todayâs lecture concludes Professor Freemanâs discussion of the four phases of the Revolutionary War. Americaâs victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 marked the end of the third phase of the war, and led to a turning point in the conflict: Franceâs decision to recognize American independence and enter into an alliance with the fledging nation. Although the British made one final attempt at reconciliation in 1778 with the Conciliatory Propositions, they were rejected by the Continental Congress. The fourth and final phase of the war lasted from 1779 to 1781, as the British Army focused its attention on the American South. The British seized Charleston and South Carolina, and defeated the Continental Army in a series of battles. But with the help of the French fleet, Washington was able to defeat Cornwallisâs army at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Peace negotiations to end the Revolutionary War began in Paris in June of 1782."
140,"Professor Freeman discusses the nature of society before the Revolution. She argues that there were three predominant strains of thought, which she calls âthe radicals.â½� She also describes how the war gave rise to nationalist sentiment in America, including the KKK and the KKK. These feelings found figureheads in the military and among the colonizers, as well as in the media. Professor Freeman also offers a number of examples of how these types of social and political events resulted in the polarization of American society.","In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the experiences of African Americans, women, and Native Americans during the Revolution, framing her discussion within a larger historical debate over whether or not the Revolution was âradical.â Freeman ultimately concludes that while white American males improved their position in society as a result of the Revolution, women, African Americans, and Native Americans did not benefit in the same ways."
141,"Professor Freeman discusses the immediate passage of the Virginia Resolves, which had been debating the issue of taxes for a century. The councils in Virginia had sent King George III several conflicting resolutions in the previous months signaling their intention to impose taxes on the colonies. The meeting of theVirginia Resolves resulted in four pieces of formal resolution: the Virginia House of Burgessesâ resolution on slavery; the Virginia General Assemblyâs decision on an equal-virginity Bill; the meeting of both houses of the Congress in July 1765; and the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture by describing the aftermath of the collapse of the British monarchy.","Professor Freeman discusses the mounting tensions between the colonists and the British in the late 1760s and early 1770s. The Virginia Resolves were published and read throughout the colonies in 1765, and generated discussion about colonial rights and liberties. Colonies began working together to resolve their problems, and formed the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. Meanwhile, Boston was becoming more radicalized and mobs began acting out their frustration with British policies. Colonists began to believe that the British were conspiring to oppress their liberties, a belief that seemed to be confirmed when the British stationed troops in Boston. The mounting tension between the Bostonians and British troops culminated in the violence of the Boston Massacre in March 1770."
142,"Professor Freeman discusses the Articles of Confederation, arguing that the most crucial lesson that American society learned during the Revolution was that it could be trusted with power - a vital quality in a nation fearful of the collapse of republican governance at the hands of a tyrant. Yet throughout the colonies, local declarations of independence resulted in large-scale gatherings like the Mount Vernon Conference in July 1776. Some time later, the colonies were debating the issue of representation in the Senate. These discussions include the role of women in the military, the influence of poll taxes on males, and the influence they exercised on colonial politicians. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture by suggesting that the ultimate lesson of the American Revolution is that the political process of government is not always representative of the best ways for Americans to participate in the Revolution.","This lecture discusses the ongoing political experimentation involved in creating new constitutions for the new American states. Having declared independence from Great Britain, Americans had to determine what kind of government best suited their individual states as well as the nation at large; to many, this was the âwhole objectâ of their revolutionary turmoil. Different people had different ideas about what kind of republican government would work best for their state. Should there be a unicameral or a bicameral legislature? How should political representation be organized and effected? How far should the principle of popular sovereignty be taken?"
143,"Professor Freeman discusses the debate over slavery in the 1850s. The central figure in this discussion was Henry Clay, who was in the government for a number of years before he died. In 1849, the southern legislatures were debating the issue of representation. They were concerned about how the expansion of the slave society would encourage northerners to strike against the new political leaders. In late 1850, the Supreme Court offered a narrow reading of the 14th Amendment, signaling an eventual shift from the radical, anti-slavery stance of the early 1850s to the more nuanced position of the executive branch. The lecture concludes with the passage of the first Reconstruction Act, the waning radicalism of the Republican party, and the birth of the modern South.","Professor Blight narrates some of the important political crises of the 1850s. The lecture begins with an account of the Compromise of 1850, the swan song of the great congressional triumvirateâHenry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun. The lecture then describes northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act passed as part of the Compromise, and the publication of Harriet Beecher Stoweâs classicÂ in 1852. Professor Blight then introduces the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, the most pivotal political event of the decade, and the catalyst for the birth of the Republican party."
144,"Professor Blight focuses on the question of why the South did not win the battle of Appomattox in April of 1863. Blight begins with an explanation of the reason for this: the warâs violence; the fear of loss of territory; and the nature of urban decay. The lecture then moves to Confederate General Robert E. Leeâ. The declaration of hostilities prompted four more statesâ to secede, the Carolingians in particular, to take the battle to the North. The Civil War also entailed the passage of a number of Reconstruction statutes, including the Vibration Act, the Resolves bill, the Congressional Radicals bill, as well as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act. The eventful year 1868 saw the beginnings of military conflict between the Union army and Confederates in the West.","This lecture probes the reasons for confederate defeat and union victory. Professor Blight begins with an elucidation of the loss-of-will thesis, which suggests that it was a lack of conviction on the home front that assured confederate defeat, before offering another of other popular explanations for northern victory: industrial capacity, political leadership, military leadership, international diplomacy, a pre-existing political culture, and emancipation. Blight warns, however, that we cannot forget the battlefield, and, to this end, concludes his lecture with a discussion of the decisive Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July of 1863."
145,"The Blight finishes his lecture series of lectures on the war. The nature of war is discussed, and the conflict between Confederates and Union forces is explored. Doctorowâs meditations on the nature of death are read with particular attention paid to the poem â½ of which is considered as a meditation on the loss of human knowledge. Finally, the poet William Tecumseh Sherman is mentioned as a poetic oeuvre in which the Union victories over the rebels in April of 1877. The eventful year 1877 saw the beginnings of military conflict, as the Union began to seriously consider the possibility of re-emergence of the Civil War.","Professor Blight uses Herman Melvilleâs poem âOn the Slain Collegiansâ to introduce the horrifying slaughter of 1864. The architect of the strategy that would eventually lead to Union victory, but at a staggering human cost, was Ulysses S. Grant, brought East to assume control of all Union armies in 1864. Professor Blight narrates the campaigns of 1864, including the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, and the siege of Petersburg. While Robert E. Lee battled Grant to a stalemate in Virginia, however, William Tecumseh Shermanâs Union forces took Atlanta before beginning their March to the Sea, destroying Confederate morale and fighting power from the inside. Professor Blight closes his lecture with a description of the first Memorial Day, celebrated by African Americans in Charleston, SC 1865."
146,"Professor lecture focuses on the development of abolitionism in the wake of the Compromise of 1850. Douglassâs narrative is one of the most definitive works of oratory, and includes elements of African American culture, such as the mythical figure of Beethoven, the figure of the â­�Jewel in the Woods.� Douglass also draws a distinction between his poetic subjectivity and that of the common man; the distinction he makes between him and God is not accidental; the book of J. D. Salinger contains some of the best passages from African American history, including the Song of Songs recorded at the end of the Reconstruction era. The final portion of the lecture turns to the discussion of the Fourth of July, with particular attention paid to the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868.","In this lecture, Professor Blight discusses some of the conflicts, controversies, and compromises that led up to the Civil War. After analyzing Frederick Douglassâs 1852 Fourth of July speech and the inherent conflict between American slavery and American freedom, the lecture moves into a lengthy discussion of the war with Mexico in the 1840s. Professor Blight explains why northerners and southerners made âsuch a fussâ over the issue of slaveryâs expansion into the western territories. The lecture ends with the crisis over Californiaâs admission to statehood and the Compromise of 1850."
147,"Professor Blight lectures on the nature of war. The author of the first part of the lecture is Louisa May Alcottâs, a narrative novel based upon the life of Anna Julia Cooper and W. E. B. Du Bois. The novel explores the complicated messages about loss and human encounter as depicted in the picaresque novels of World War I, with particular emphasis placed on the narratorâUlysses S. Grantââ½�s portrayal of the disempowerment of soldiers in the trenches. Professor Blight closes the lecture by describing the horrific battle of Shiloh, fought in April of 1862.","Professor Blight discusses the expectations, advantages, and disadvantages with which North and South entered the Civil War. Both sides, he argues, expected and desired a short, contained conflict. The northern advantages enumerated in this lecture include industrial capability, governmental stability, and a strong navy. Confederate advantages included geography and the ability to fight a defensive war. Professor Blight concludes the lecture with the Battle of Bull Run, the first major engagement of the war."
148,"Professor Blight finishes his discussion of the Civil War by focusing on four turning points: the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863; the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in August of 1865; the Unionâs invasion of Charleston, SC; and the passage of the Dred Scott decision to secede. The decision not to allow the military to go to war in the North was made difficult, and the Congress was forced to consider a number of contingents. The lecture concludes with Confederate General Thomas â½ Williamsâ­� decision to take the battle to Appomattox.","Professor Blight follows Robert E. Leeâs army north into Maryland during the summer of 1862, an invasion that culminated in the Battle of Antietam, fought in September of 1862. In the wake of Antietam, Abraham Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, a document that changed the meaning of the war forever. Professor Blight suggests some of the ways in which Americans have attempted to come to grips with the enigmatic Lincoln, and argues that, in the end, it may be Lincolnâs capacity for change that was his most important characteristic. The lecture concludes with the story of John Washington, a Virginia slave whose concerted action suggests the central role American slaves played in securing their own freedom."
149,"Professor Blight continues his discussion of Civil War history, focusing on African-American experiences. The war had a political, cultural, and economic impact equal to that of the British. Professor Blight describes the conflict as a moment of âracial reckoning,â½� in which the violence of the war resulted not only in the loss of civilian life, but also in the emergence of new social groups, such as the PUSH, the KKK, and the various types of organizations that contributed to this upsurge. The lecture concludes with an examination of the historical profession, taking as a case study what it means to be American.","Professor Blight begins his lecture with a description of the sea change in Civil War scholarship heralded by the Social History revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Along with a focus on the experience of the common solider, women, and African Americans, a central component of this shift in scholarly emphasis was an increased interest in the effects of the war on the Union and Confederate home fronts. After suggesting some of the ways in which individual Americans experienced the war, Professor Blight moves to a discussion of the warâs effect on industry and economics, North and South. The lecture concludes with a description of the increased activism of the federal government during the war, an activism that found expression in finance, agriculture, taxation, building railroads, and, most importantly, in emancipation."
150,"Professor the most famous American abolitionist, John Brown had a life quite separate from that of other abolitionists. In his book, âThe Mapâ½� Professor Blight discusses the decision to seat alternate delegates in the election of 1857 and the Supreme Court deciding the fate of the U.S. Constitution. The decision not only sets the stage for the eventual passage of the Dred Scott decision, it also shows the judicial workings of the political system. The central figure in the early phase of Reconstruction was Abraham Lincoln, who was forced to carry on the work of obstructing Congressional Reconstruction. When the Republican candidate, John C. Fremont, introduced the radical provisions of the Wade-Davis bill, the southern states seceded. The remainder of the lecture focuses on the four branches of the Republican party, led by Fort Sumter. The nature of the executive branch is then discussed, with particular attention paid to the rhetoric and organizing efforts of the various factions in the Senate.","Professor Blight narrates the momentous events of 1857, 1858, and 1859. The lecture opens with an analysis of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. Next, Blight analyzes the Dred Scott decision and discusses what it meant for northernersâparticularly African Americansâto live in âthe land of the Dred Scott decision.â The lecture then shifts to John Brown. Professor Blight begins by discussing the way that John Brown has been remembered in art and literature, and then offers a summary of Brownâs life, closing with his raid on Harpers Ferry in October of 1859."
151,"Professor Blight discusses the controversy over slavery. Blight begins with an argument about the nature of the slave system. The nature of slavery is discussed, and the lecture focuses on the southern defense of the Civil War from Fort Sumter. The eventful year 1861 saw the passage of four constitutions (the Congressional Resolves) that outlawed slavery in the US; the signing of the Dred Scott decision in 1868; the passage by Confederate General Thomas âStonewallâ½� Jackson; and the eventual passage of the Wade-Davis bill. The lecture concludes with a discussion of some of the rationales underlying southern secession.","Professor Blight lectures on southern slavery. He makes a case for viewing the U.S. South as one of the five true âslave societiesâ in world history. He discusses the internal slave trade that moved thousands of slaves from the eastern seaboard to the cotton states of the Southwest between 1820 and 1860. Professor Blight then sketches the contents of the pro-slavery argument, including its biblical, historical, economic, cynical, and utopian aspects."
152,"Professor Blight continues his discussion of slavery. The lecture focuses on the nature of southern history, with particular emphasis placed on the Dred Scott decision in the 1850s. Blight argues that throughout the history of the region, African Americans have experienced extreme forms of violence, including gerrymandering and poll taxes. The most lasting and influential source of such violence is the word âcowardâ½. The eventful year 1857 saw the resurgence of the KKK, an organization that was forced to exile for ten years before reentering the Union in the 1860s. The second half of the lecture turns to the early years of 1865, when President Lincoln offered the Civil Rights Act of 1868 to establish the basis for the Slavery movement. The passage of the Congressional Reconstruction Act in 1868 prompted four more states to secede, the first describing the process of secession in the Reconstruction South.","Having finished with slavery and the pro-slavery argument, Professor Blight heads North today. The majority of the lecture deals with the rise of the Market Revolution in the North, in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. Blight first describes the causes of the Market Revolutionâthe rise of capital, a transportation revolutionâand then moves to its effects on the culture and consciousness of antebellum northerners. Among these effects were a riotous optimism mixed with a deep-rooted fear of change, an embrace of the notions of progress and Manifest Destiny, and the intensification of the divides between North and South."
153,"The begin of the lecture, Professor Shiller emphasizes two purposes of options: a put and a call option. A put option is the right to sell a whole lot of American options at a particular price. The call-option form, which is the first of a series of lectures, addresses some of the issues that have been raised in the past. Subsequently, he introduces the core elements of the American options market: the parity between European options and U.S. options, and the difference between those markets versus those in the European options market. In the second half of the class, he addresses the put-call parity between the United States and Europe as well as the differences between the European countries in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09. He addresses the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a place to start by looking at the history of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from its inception in the late 19 and early 20 century. He ends the lecture with a thoughts about the powerful influence of the single-family home on the dynamics of the modern domestic market.","Options introduce an essential nonlineary into portfolio management. They are contracts between buyers and writers, who agree on exercise prices and dates at which the buyer can buy or sell the underlying (such as a stock). Options are priced based on the price and volatility of the underlying asset as well as the duration of the option contract. The Black-Scholes options pricing model is one of the most famous equations in finance and offers a useful first approximation for prices for option contracts. Options exchanges and futures exchanges both are involved in creating a liquid and transparent market for options. Options are not just for stocks; they are also important for other asset classes, such as real estate."
154,"Professor lecturer David Swensen reviews the Yale endowmentâs performance in the last class. Professor Swensen looks at the Yale runoffs from 2007-2008, culminating in a three-way analysis of the returns that the various strategies employed during this era determine the level of interest and the role of each agent in the Yale system. He then turns his attention to the Yale municipal endowment, which was created in 2009 to manage the allocation of municipal resources. The endowment draws heavily from the municipal endowments, which are used to manage municipal budgets and to encourage the expansion of the municipal market. In the second half of the lecture, he discusses the Yale board of directors as a means of self-regulating the speculative activity of the Yale financial system. The lecture concludes with a discussion of the neutral balance sheets at the end of the class, an indicator of the importance of the endowment for the economy.","Regulation of financial and securities markets is intended to protect investors while still enabling them to make personal investment decisions. Psychological phenomena, such as magical thinking, overconfidence, and representativeness heuristic can cause deviations from rational behavior and distort financial decision-making. However, regulation and regulatory bodies, such as the SEC, FDIC, and SIPC, most of which were created just after the Great Depression, are intended to help prevent the manipulation of investorsâ psychological foibles and maintain trust in the markets so that a broad spectrum of investors will continue to participate."
155,"Professor Summers, former U. S. Treasury Secretary and former President of Harvard, offers a way of thinking about the two types of recessions. The first type of recession is considered in the context of the theory of disinflation recessions, in which the Fed can raise interest rates to create an optimal level of leverage. Then, the economist moves on to the second half of the lecture, describing the economic cycles from 2007-09. He looks at recent economic cycles that have appeared to be connected with the Great Depression, in particular the financial crisis of 2007-2008. He comments on the role of bubbles in recessions: they are caused by the speculative activity of the âhotter sort of people,� rather than the fact that the economy is growing faster than the other segments of the economy. In the second part of this lecture, he looks at the balance between the two forms of recession, looking at how the Fed could solve for the problem of bank runs. He then turns his attention to the notion of the subprime mortgage crisis, focusing on New York Cityâs row house vacancy problem, as represented by the recent collapse of the Chicago Board of Trade. At the end of","In the second of his two lectures in honor of Arthur Okun, Professor Summers points out that real interest rates have been very low in the current subprime crisis. This indicates that the shock to the economy was more a financial breakdown shock than a disinflation shock. But financial breakdown shocks are not necessarily very harmful to the economy, so long as financial intermediation capital is not destroyed. In a financial crisis like the present one, financial firms are likely to take the step of decreasing their leverage, often by contracting loans, which creates its own risks for the economy. Regulators should place pressure on financial institutions to raise their capital and should intervene in near foreclosure situations, but should not attempt to support housing prices."
156,"Port allocation is an important concept in investment management. An allocation of resources is crucial to diversification. The allocation of money in stocks and other assets must be judged by the same performance criteria as in other portfolios. We consider how diversification can create a diversified portfolio, and how we can enhance the Sharpe ratio among our portfolio classes. Finally, we finish by looking at some of the strategies that weâll need to take into account the allocation of stocks and bonds in the future.","David Swensen, Yaleâs Chief Investment Officer and manager of the Universityâs endowment, discusses the tactics and tools that Yale and other endowments use to create long-term, positive investment returns. He emphasizes the importance of asset allocation and diversification and the limited effects of market timing and security selection. Also, the extraordinary returns of hedge funds, one of the more recent phenomena of portfolio management, should be looked at closely, with an eye for survivorship and back-fill biases."
157,"Professor Schwarzman, a prominent activist investor in finance, discusses his recent article, The Blackstone Foundationâs (Blackstone) and Peter Petersonâ½. He explores the notion of the â²-octet, the imaginary world in which the wind is perfectly smooth and equal. Then he moves on to his own initiative, the Blackstone Initiative, to create an alternative market for emerging markets that would satisfy the minds and bodies of interested parties. In the final segment of the lecture, he comments about his thinking about different types of investments. He ends by answering several questions from students.","The stock market is the information center for the corporate sector. It represents individualsâ ownership in publicly-held corporations. Although corporations have a variety of stakeholders, the shareholders of a for-profit corporation are central since the company is ultimately responsible to them. Companies offer dividends, stock repurchases and stock dividends to give profits back to shareholders or to signal information. Companies can also take on debt to raise capital, creating leverage. The Modigliani-Miller theory of a companyâs leverage in its simplest form implies the leverage ratio doesnât matter, but including bankruptcy costs and tax effects give us a positive theory of the ratio."
158,"Professorutures markets were started in Osaka, Japan in 1969 to create an alternative to the traditional one-hour labor market. The Blackstone Group, a private equity group, was created in Shanghai in 1969 by the Chinese government to manage the allocation of resources for the companyâs various uses of the island of Vieques. Vieques residents are filing complaints about corruption at the federal, state, and local levels. These issues include: how the interest rate is communicated to the wider population; whether the public will be sold as a profitable investment asset; how the corporation will be able to raise revenues from its own profit margin; and how the economy will evolve beyond the current crisis. Schwarzman also discusses his views on Russia in the future. He sees opportunities for Russian investors to diversify their resources into other types of assets.","Stephen Schwarzman, Co-Founder of Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, speaks about his experience in the industry. He discusses his thoughts on global finance, particularly at such an interesting and challenging point in the history of financial institutions. Although the near future might be rough for the United States and economies around the globe, capital does tend to come back and regulators are busy figuring out how best to put safeguards on the system. He also offers career advice and mentions some of the surprises he came across upon entering the world of finance."
159,"Professorutures markets are the most important risk management device for finance. They allow investors to create diversified portfolios and reap some tax benefits for funding their retirement income. In some cases, the diversification of an asset can lead to a bad performance. In other cases, this has led to a negative outcome. The trouble with the theory is that in some countries, the best return opportunities are less valuable than in others. The lecture concludes with a discussion of the role of investment managers in society.","Insurance provides significant risk management to a broad public, and is an essential tool for promoting human welfare. By pooling large numbers of independent or low-correlated risks, insurance providers can minimize overall risk. The risk management is tailored to individual circumstances and reflects centuries of insurance industry experience with real risks and with moral hazard and selection bias issues. Probability theory and statistical tools help to explain how insurance companies use risk pooling to minimize overall risk. Innovation and government regulation have played important roles in the formation and oversight of insurance institutions."
160,"The the Universal Principle of Risk Management, a concept that arose in the 1600s to encompass probability and financial resources, it has been copied around the world to allow the spread of risk from one level to another. The second half of the lecture introduces the basic concepts of probability and pooling: the idea of random walkers and the hedging of risk. Then we discuss the central elements of probability theory: the notion of the âright sortâ½� and the idea (the neutral kind) of risk pooling. We explore the creation of taxanomic communities in the early seventeenth century to encourage the aggregation of risk into the productive classes. Finally, we turn to an important concept in finance: the Hedging of Risk.","Statistics and mathematics underlie the theories of finance. Probability Theory and various distribution types are important to understanding finance. Risk management, for instance, depends on tools such as variance, standard deviation, correlation, and regression analysis. Financial analysis methods such as present values and valuing streams of payments are fundamental to understanding the time value of money and have been in practice for centuries."
161,"We develop an idea of subgame perfection in which players choose between Up or Down and then choose a strategy that is equally plausible. Then we consider strategies that are inconsistent with backward induction, finding that sometimes the game has more information to do with the playerâs actions than it does with the other games in the game. We discuss some implications of this fact in particular games, such as picking a strategy to avoid cheating on your taxes. Toward the end of class, we introduce a new idea: Nash equilibrium. A way of capture both simultaneity in moves and sequential moves in a game is introduced: sub-game perfection.","We analyze three games using our new solution concept, subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE). The first game involves playersâ trusting that others will not make mistakes. It has three Nash equilibria but only one is consistent with backward induction. We show the other two Nash equilibria are not subgame perfect: each fails to induce Nash in a subgame. The second game involves a matchmaker sending a couple on a date. There are three Nash equilibria in the dating subgame. We construct three corresponding subgame perfect equilibria of the whole game by rolling back each of the equilibrium payoffs from the subgame. Finally, we analyze a game in which a firm has to decide whether to invest in a machine that will reduce its costs of production. We learn that the strategic effects of this decisionâits effect on the choices of other competing firmsâcan be large, and if we ignore them we will make mistakes."
162,"We develop a new idea: cash in a hat. Then we introduce the idea of paying taxes. We learn that, as players, if they put enough money in the hat, then the other players will have to compensate each of their accumulated costs. This is an important step in the game, because it lets us calculate the proportions of people who will contribute to the economy. Then there is a way for us to choose from among the various strategies in the class. We discuss some implications of this rather pessimistic view of the game and our attitudes towards it. As an example, we consider a game in which the players can choose whether or not to enter the game.","We consider games in which players move sequentially rather than simultaneously, starting with a game involving a borrower and a lender. We analyze the game using âbackward induction.â The game features moral hazard: the borrower will not repay a large loan. We discuss possible remedies for this kind of problem. One remedy involves incentive design: writing contracts that give the borrower an incentive to repay. Another involves commitment strategies; in this case providing collateral. We consider other commitment strategies such as burning boats. But the key lesson of the day is the idea of backward induction."
163,"We first define an equilibrium model of the election from last time. Then we show how the candidates can choose their positions. We then show how, in this model, the primary winner is a middle-of-the-party candidate and the primary voter are a democratic candidate. Toward the end of class, we introduce a new idea: Nash Equilibrium. In this way we show that the real and perceived threat to the candidacy of a third-partycandidate is a threat to all rational choices. Finally, we ask whether or not it is rational to enter the election in a predictable way.","We first complete our discussion of the candidate-voter model showing, in particular, that, in equilibrium, two candidates cannot be too far apart. Then we play and analyze Schellingâs location game. We discuss how segregation can occur in society even if no one desires it. We also learn that seemingly irrelevant details of a model can matter. We consider randomizations first by a central authority (such as in a bussing policy), and then decentralized randomization by the individuals themselves, âmixed strategies.â Finally, we look at rock, paper, scissors to see an example of a mixed-strategy equilibrium to a game."
164,"We game of an entrant and an incumbent in a market. Then we consider a situation in which the incumbent knows the game will be won by the other players. We then consider two strategies: either the incumbent can choose to continue or to fight; this is a bad strategy, because the incumbent cannot afford to do so. We look at examples of such games, including a threat to a leaderâs reputation if he does not know what will make him happiest. Then our discussion turns to a discussion of two strategies in each market: either there is a strong incentive for agents to enter the game; and this is followed by a critique of the anti-Markovnikov strategy used in the first half of the lecture: the lesson here is that it is precisely the politics of these games that sets the stage for the emergence of the capitalist spirit.","In the first half of the lecture, we consider the chain-store paradox. We discuss how to build the idea of reputation into game theory; in particular, in setting like this where a threat or promise would otherwise not be credible. The key idea is that players may not be completely certain about other playersâ payoffs or even their rationality. In the second half of the lecture, we stage a duel, a game of pre-emption. The key strategic question in such games is when; in this case, when to fire. We use two ideas from earlier lectures, dominance and backward induction, to analyze the game. Finally we discuss two biases found in Americans: overconfidence and over-valuing being pro-active."
165,"We introduce Game Theory to biology. We learn that strategies are related to genes and their payoffs to genetic fitness. Then we discuss the relationship between strategy and profit. We discuss why we might be interested in different strategies, and how we might predict from what weâll do. Toward the end, we introduce a new idea: adaptive strategies. This is called adaptive strategy, and we learn that some strategies are more valuable than others if they are rational and rational.","We discuss evolution and game theory, and introduce the concept of evolutionary stability. We ask what kinds of strategies are evolutionarily stable, and how this idea from biology relates to concepts from economics like domination and Nash equilibrium. The informal argument relating these ideas toward at the end of his lecture contains a notation error. A more formal argument is provided in the supplemental notes."
166,"Mr, Professor David Swensen, a Yale graduate and manager of Whitebox Advisors, a hedge fund, discusses the Swensenâs model, which seeks to create an asymmetrical portfolio that allows for optimal diversification and liquidity. The strategy is then applied to the setting up of swap markets in the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The first half of the lecture talks about the creation of the Yale model and the subsequent evolution of it. The second half of this lecture looks at the role of swaps markets in understanding the economy and the financial system. In the remainder of the class, the topics of the conversation include: the Shiller Home Price Index, the VIX index, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, as well as the recent change to the national interest rate from the savings and loan crisis.","This lecture is a guest lecture by Professor David Swensen, Yale Universityâs Chief Investment Officer. The starting point for Professor Swensen is an article entitled, published in in the wake of the financial crisis from 2007-2008. This article blames his endowment investment approach for a failure of diversification and an overemphasis on alternatives. Subsequently, Professor Swensen characterizes three major determinants of investment returnâasset allocation, market timing, and security selectionâand outlines the importance of asset allocation as the predominant component. Against the background of these three tenets, he revisits criticism and defends the virtues of diversification against an exaggerated perception of the needs for safety in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. Moreover, he counters the critique of overemphasizing alternatives with a longer-term view on the performance of the Yale portfolio. In the concluding question-and-answer session, he elaborates on the difference between endowment management and fund management, recent developments in the hedge fund and private equity fund industry, and on measures of investment performance beyond the Sharpe ratio."
167,"Professor Shiller introduces the course and sets the stage for the first of two lectures: Financial Markets. He provides an overview of the main themes of the course: financial markets, investment banking, financial crises, moral hazard, and democratization of finance. He also provides a brief history of his time in the U.S. as a regulator in the insurance business. During the first part of the lecture, Professor Shiller discusses the importance of historical lessons for farmers and present opportunities for all manner of hedgers and arbitrageurs. He then turns his attention to the young people in the economy, who are often left behind in the economic fluctuations of the last three or ten years. He ends by answering several questions from students.","Professor Shiller provides a description of the course, including its general theme, the relevant textbooks, as well as the interplay of his course with Professor Geanakoplosâs course âEconomics 251 â Financial Theory.â Finance, in his view, is a pillar of civilized society, dealing with the allocation of resources through space and time in order to manage big and important risks. After talking about finance as an occupation, he emphasizes the moral imperative to use wealth for the purposes of philanthropy, in the spirit of Andrew Carnegie, but also of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Subsequently, he introduces the guest speakers David Swensen, Yale Universityâs chief investment officer, Maurice âHankâ Greenberg, former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at American International Group (AIG) and current CEO of C.V. Starr & Co. and of Starr International, and Laura Cha, former vice chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong and of the government of the Peopleâs Republic of China, and"
168,"Professor Estate finance is a complicated history of mortgage lending. There are three main types of mortgages: first, commercial real estate, and residential real estate. The structure of the mortgage is very complicated, and we cannot âbeat the market.â½ We can look at the history of one mortgage after another and see how the interest rate and other financial phenomenon impact the second half of the 19 century. Then we consider an analysis of some of the collateral prepayments that take place in the mortgage market. We look at two types of collateral: prepayment as a means to recuperate the balance of balances; prepaytization as a way to reap the desired endowment. This leads us to a discussion of the kinds of collateral that can be added to a mortgage. Finally, we look at a recent study of the subprime mortgage crisis, in which the agent on the home was the homeowner.","Real estate finance has been crucially important throughout its very long and complex history. Describing the history of mortgage financing, Professor Shiller highlights the historical development of well-institutionalized property rights for mortgage contracts. Subsequently, he focuses on modern financial institutions for commercial real estate, elaborating on Direct Participation Programs and Real Estate Investment Trusts as means for its financing. The distinction between short-term, balloon-payment mortgages before the Great Depression and long-term, amortizing mortgages thereafter shapes the discussion of residential real estate. His discussion of mortgage securitization and government support of mortgage markets centers around Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from their inception in 1938 and 1970, respectively, to the U.S. governmentâs decision to put them into federal conservatorship in 2008. Finally, Professor Shiller covers collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and elaborates on moral hazard in the mortgage origination process."
169,"Professor people are increasingly willing to pay more for their goods than for their services. This is an important distinction between markets and clearinghouses, in which shares are traded and, in some cases, profit-sharing is a profitable form of capital raising. But, as Professor Shiller explains, the issue of asymmetries is also discussed. An explanation of this is the âresource curse,â½� that arises when one cannot afford to ignore the other because you cannot afford it yourself. The lecture concludes with a discussion of two substantive principles of economics: the allocation of scarce resources to the poor and the wealthy and the creation of a market to ensure the survival of the common good.","As the starting point for this lecture, Professor Shiller contrasts the view of economics as the theory of the allocation of scarce resources with the view of economics as the study of exchange. After a discussion of the difference between brokers and dealers, he outlines the history of securities exchanges from ancient Rome, to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Jonathanâs Coffee House in London, until the formation of the New York Stock Exchange. He complements this historic account with an overview of securities exchanges all over the world, covering India, China, Brazil, and Mexico. An example of a limit order book allows him to elaborate on the mechanics of trading at the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (NASDAQ). Subsequently, he turns his attention to the growing importance of program trading and high frequency trading, but also discusses their impact on the stock market crash from October 19, 1987, as well as on the Flash Crash from May 6, 2010. When talking about fairness in financial markets, particularly with regard to the relation between private investors and brokers, he discusses the National Market System (NMS), the Intermarket Trading System (ITS), and consolidated quotation systems. He concludes this lecture with some reflections on the operations of dealers"
170,"Professoravioral Finance, or Behavioral Economics, is a relatively recent revolution in finance that has occurred at many levels of the human mind. Humans are aware of other peopleâs weaknesses and will do anything to exploit them. Similar problems have been solved to address some of these problems, such as overconfidence and perceived kinks in the value function. Psychological responses are also discussed, including examples of irrationality and mental errors.","Deviating from an absolute belief in the principle of rationality, Professor Shiller elaborates on human failings and foibles. Acknowledging impulses to exploit these weaknesses, he emphasizes the role of factors that keep these impulses in check, specifically the desire for praise-worthiness from Adam Smithâs. After a discourse on Personality Psychology, Professor Shiller starts a list of important topics in Behavioral Finance with Daniel Kahnemanâs and Amos Tverskyâs Prospect Theory. The value function and the probability weighting function, as two key components of this theory, help explain certain patterns in peopleâs everyday decision making, e.g. the existence of diamond ring insurance and airline flight insurance. An in-class experiment underscores the prevalence and importance of the concept of overconfidence. Further topics include Regret Theory, gambling behavior, cognitive dissonance, anchoring, the representativeness heuristic, and social contagion. Professor Shiller concludes the lecture with some perspectives on moral judgment in the business world, addressing shared values and integrity."
171,"Andrewutures markets were invented in 1602 to create an authoritative and meaningful market for agricultural products, using standardized contracts. These markets are the first of a series of innovative and costly investment vehicles, designed to bring together large amounts of money from different parts of the world. These innovations create a vicious circle, whereby the hopelessness of a situation leads to the collapse of the whole system and the growth of other financial assets. They result in a vicious cycle of overconfidence, where the drop in asset prices leads to a second-order decline in the value of all existing assets. This is the essence of the âutilitarianâ model, and it has been copied around the world to allow the hedging various future risks. A cornerstone of the modern financial system is the notion of risk management, which was created to minimize the impact of a potentially infinite number of risks.","In this lecture, Professor Shiller introduces mean-variance portfolio analysis, as originally outlined by Harry Markowitz, and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that has been the cornerstone of modern financial theory. Professor Shiller commences with the history of the first publicly traded company, the United East India Company, founded in 1602. Incorporating also the more recent history of stock markets all over the world, he elaborates on the puzzling size of the equity premium and the very high historical return of stock market investments. After introducing the notion of an Efficient Portfolio Frontier, he covers the concept of the Tangency Portfolio, which leads him to the Mutual Fund Theorem. Finally, the consideration of equilibrium in the stock market leads him to the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which emphasizes market risk as the determinant of a stockâs return."
172,"Andrew lecture focuses on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which outlines the expected return and risk of an asset over a certain level of risk. The main implication of this model is that, as an asset owner, one must try to maximize the expected returns for such an asset. The trouble with this approach is that there is so much risk, and it comes from the incentives of agents to participate in the workforce. It is impossible to hedge against so many contingencies. The only realistic way to mitigate such risks is through a voluntary act of the will, called a rivocation. The lecture concludes with Shakespeareâs analogy between the moral hazard of his protagonist Salerio and the psychological crisis of the afflicted man: the latter is punished by taking on a larger and more dangerous burden of proof. The second half of the lecture looks at the troubles facing the Social Security system, where the failure of the progressive progressive tax system leads to the collapse of the real estate market.","Until now we have ignored risk aversion. The Bernoulli brothers were the first to suggest a tractable way of representing risk aversion. They pointed out that an explanation of the St. Petersburg paradox might be that people care about expected utility instead of expected income, where utility is some concave function, such as the logarithm. One of the most famous and important models in financial economics is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which can be derived from the hypothesis that every agent has a (different) quadratic utility. Much of the modern mutual fund industry is based on the implications of this model. The model describes what happens to prices and asset holdings in general equilibrium when the underlying risks canât be hedged in the aggregate. It turns out that the tools we developed in the beginning of this course provide an answer to this question."
173,"The can be used to analyze the three main types of options in the economy: callable bonds, subprime mortgage obligations, and mortgages. In some cases, the option is worth more than the actual interest rate. Subprime mortgage offers a non-contingent option to generate an income tax precedent for the prime maturities of multiple mortgage pools. It is important to consider the prepayments as spreads in the economic system. If the interest rate is 4%, the remaining balance is much lower than that. The option to end the mortgage is surprisingly valuable.","This lecture is about optimal exercise strategies for callable bonds, which are bonds bundled with an option that allows the borrower to pay back the loan early, if she chooses. Using backward induction, we calculate the borrowerâs optimal strategy and the value of the option. As with the simple examples in the previous lecture, the option value turns out to be very large. The most important callable bond is the fixed rate amortizing mortgage; calling a mortgage means prepaying your remaining balance. We examine how high bankers must set the mortgage rate in order to compensate for the prepayment option they give homeowners. Looking at data on mortgage rates we see that mortgage borrowers often fail to prepay optimally."
174,"Professor Fisher uses the budget set from the last class to analyze the balance of the gross domestic product (GDP). He then turns his attention to the one-year budget set, looking at trends in the economy that will continue to increase the gap. The first half of the lecture looks at the two forms of this âbought dealâ½�: the first year of the 21 century and the first half after the financial crisis of 2007-09. Professor Fisher then looks at reforms enacted to address the problem of amour-propre, i.e. changes to the tax-compliance model as the economy becomes more electronic.","In the 1990s, Yale discovered that it was faced with a deferred maintenance problem: the university hadnât properly planned for important renovations in many buildings. A large, one-time expenditure would be needed. How should Yale have covered these expenses? This lecture begins by applying the lessons learned so far to show why Yaleâs initial forecast budget cuts were overly pessimistic. In the second half of the class, we turn to the problem of measuring investment performance, and examine the strengths and weaknesses of various measures of yield, including yield-to-maturity and current yield."
175,"We are willing to bet at even odds in order to minimize the risk of angering a poor person. The trouble with hedging is that, in some cases, the Yankees can win a lot of money over the course of a three-game series. Even if the Dodgers win the whole Series, the Dodgers will win a seven game series once they are up 2 games to 1. This would be an extraordinary outcome for the Dodgers as a whole. But, as we saw in the first part of the lecture, there are several ways to hedge your bets: either by taking as much as possible against what the Dodgers might do. To prevent such a scenario, we consider a number of different strategies: wagers, placements, and arbitrageurs. Toward the end, we introduce a new notion: Nash Equilibrium.","This lecture reviews the intuition from the previous class, where the idea of dynamic hedging was introduced. We learn why the crucial idea of dynamic hedging is marking to market: even when there are millions of possible scenarios that could come to pass over time, by hedging a little bit each step of the way, the number of possibilities becomes much more manageable. We conclude the discussion of hedging by introducing a measure for the average life of a bond, and show how traders use this to figure out the appropriate hedge against interest rate movements."
176,Coevolution is the process through which species come into evolutionary equilibrium. There are three main types of relationships: species tend to cluster first into distinct populations before finally becoming different species.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at:,"The lecture presents an overview of evolutionary biology and its two major components, microevolution and macroevolution. The idea of evolution goes back before Darwin, although Darwin thought of natural selection. Evolution is driven by natural selection, the correlation between organism traits and reproductive success, as well as random drift. The history of life goes back approximately 3.7 billion years to a common ancestor, and is marked with key events that affect all life.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at:"
177,"This are two interesting cases in which evolutionary thought has impacted the human condition. Evolution is not âdownward,â½� as we might think. There is a division between individual interest and group interest, and this division is often said to result from irrationality or profiteering. But the distinction is made between individuals and groups. Similar divisions are drawn drawn between the individual and the collective as well as between these groups. These divisions are then explored in an attempt to determine whether or not the individual will behave in certain ways.","There is a distinct possibility that humans are currently part way through an evolutionary transition between individuals and groups. The conflict between these two units of selection and levels of organization, between biology and culture, may explain some of the tensions in modern human life. Examples of selfishness and altruism exemplify how these types of selection act on humans."
178,"The can be studied in terms of the physical and chemical aspects of the environment. Different tissues in the environment are analyzed to determine the particularity of each unit of the species. The greenhouse effect in the atmosphere is discussed as an example of the metabolic processes that affect the survival of an organism from a different species. Another important consideration of the greenhouse effect is the idea of homeostasis, in which organisms must learn how to store water and nutrients.","Every species on earth has an environmental range in which it can live. Usually it flourishes in the central portion of this range. Organisms contain a host of adaptations that allow them to manipulate their environments to remain within their preferred range. Plants and animals differ in the nature of these adaptations, which include the control of water, temperature, pH, and ion concentration."
179,"Speetics is the study of phylogenetic graphs. Natural selection determines how necessary diversity is for an organism to have a common ancestor. Molecular genetic analysis helps us understand how we can build a phylogenetic tree of life on top of a generic one. An important resource for usurious creatures, such as primates and whales, is our understanding of the evolutionary basis of the Tree of Life.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at:","The Tree of Life must be discovered through rigorous analysis. Genetic information is crucial because appearances can be deceiving, and species that look similar can prove to be genetically very dissimilar and not share recent common ancestors. Two criteria, used to determine what the âcorrectâ Tree is, are simplicity and whether the tree maximizes the probability of observing what we actually see."
180,"Adaptevolution is the process through which species come to be at evolutionary equilibrium. It is not an organism, but an organism. There are stages of this process, from the mixing of water and air, to the ascension of nitrogen to the ocean. The process of discovery of mitochondria and chloroplasts is then discussed in depth. Finally, the question of where the mitochondrion came from is addressed.","The history of life and evolution has been characterized by several key events. These events can be grouped as new hierarchal levels of selection coming into play, as biological units coming together in symbiosis and specialization, or in a number of other ways. Other important events are situations of conflict resolution or information transmission, from the genetic to the cultural level."
181,"We introduce the evolutionary game theory of games. Then we consider some implications of the new insights we have in evolutionary games: that, for instance, what is it to do when one does not know the other playerâs behavior will differ across the game. We learn that, in some games, the strategy you choose not to engage in a predictable process; in others, the decision-making power of the players is asymmetrical. We discuss some examples of such games, such as picking a common strategy among them all and finding Nash equilibria in sequential games. Finally, we discuss an example from nature that involves an aggressive strategy but a defensive strategy.","The economic concept of game theory can be readily applied to evolution and behavior. By analyzing encounters between organisms as a mathematical âgame,â important information such as fitness payoffs and the proportions of âstrategiesâ played by each group within a population can be inferred. While oftentimes these games are too simplified to apply directly to actual examples in nature, they are still useful models that help convey important concepts."
182,"Sexualomic selection is the product of sexual selection. Natural selection is not necessarily synonymous with abortion. There are several definitions of the word âveggie,â½� and â±, which may be used to describe two or more parts of the human body. Recombination is not particularly strong, nor is it erotic, as is the case with avian mortality. The difference between males and females in the same species can result in a reciprocal cycle of violence. In addition to the violence that is normally associated with intersexual selection, there are other aspects of reproductive selection that are unique among the great apes, probably because eggs are so scarce in these species.","There are several explanations for the evolution of sex and its continued prevalence. One is facilitating the spread of helpful mutations while hastening the removal of harmful ones. Another is expediting resistance against pathogens. Sex does have several costs compared to asex, such as only giving half your genome to offspring, having to find mates, and the risk of predation and STDs. Overall, the benefits outweigh the costs and sex has a firm hold on the majority of the recent branches of the tree of life."
183,"The inter-specific competition between species 1 and 2 has a negative effect on population growth. In inter-related competition, an organism will have a higher death rate than an organism of a different species 1. This competition produces a reciprocal cycle of food and other resources. Then there is the issue of ecological competition. Here, the marginal cost of not having an adequate population density is minimal.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at:","Competition among species, or interspecific competition, can have an even greater effect on selection than competition within species (intraspecific competition). This is often the case in lower density populations. Different species can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on each otherâs fitness, and the effect species 1 has on species 2 is not necessarily the same that 2 has on 1. The effects that cohabiting species have on each other shapes evolution the same way that selective pressures from within a species or the physical environment shapes it."
184,"The begins with a game of tennis, a sport in which the players can choose whether or not to enter the game and are allowed to talk about their behavior. This is followed by a discussion of the relationship between mass and velocity. A question is then posed about what constitutes an action. Finally, a number of problems are solved to demonstrate how concepts like mass and momentum are approached differently in quantum mechanics.","The course begins with a discussion of electricity. The concept of charge is introduced, and the properties of electrical forces are compared with those of other familiar forces, such as gravitation. Coulombâs Law, along with the principle of superposition, allows for the calculation of electrostatic forces from a given charge distribution."
185,The is the first of a series of lectures on Maxwellâs equations. The second half of the lecture is an introduction to the nature and behavior of waves. The wave equation is introduced and used to illustrate the concepts of free space and currents. The energy stored in the electric field is derived.,"Waves on a string are reviewed and the general solution to the wave equation is described. Maxwellâs equations in their final form are written down and then considered in free space, away from charges and currents. It is shown how to verify that a given set of fields obeys Maxwellâs equations by considering them on infinitesimal cubes and loops. A simple form of the solutions is assumed and the parameters therein fitted using Maxwellâs equations. The wave equation follows, along with the wave speed equal to that of light (3 x 10^8), suggesting (correctly) that light is an electromagnetic wave. The vector relationship between the electric field, the magnetic field and the direction of wave propagation is described."
186,"The is the first of a series of lectures on quantum mechanics. The discussion begins with the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, which states that in one dimension there is a unique acceleration. The second half of the lecture introduces Newtonâs laws of motion and their application to dynamics. The uncertainty principle is introduced along with the possibility of traveling faster than in a straight line.","The time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger Equation is introduced as a powerful analog of Newtonâs second law of motion that describes quantum dynamics. It is shown how given an initial wave function, one can predict the future behavior using SchrÃ¶dingerâs Equation. The special role of stationary states (states of definite energy) is discussed."
187,"The discussion of quantum mechanics continues but this time the focus is on kinematics. The invariance of a particleâs motion is its probability density. A scattering problem is studied to expose more quantum wonders: a particle can go over the limit of its mobility. Finally, an infinite number of protons are allowed to exist in a system of space.",The fact that the wave function provides the complete description of a particleâs location and momentum is emphasized. Measurement collapses the wave function into a spike located at the measured value. The quantization of momentum for a particle on a ring is deduced.
188,The electric field is computed using Gaussâs Law. The charge density in a fluid volume is computed. Gauss also defines the mode of signal transmission in a spherical charge. The energy stored in this mode is derived. The concept of superposition is introduced. The notion of electric flux is used to illustrate the utility of the charge density as an alternative means of storing charge.,The law of conservation of energy is reviewed using examples drawn from Newtonian mechanics. The work-energy theorem is derived from first principles and used to initiate a discussion of the vector calculus underlying the law of conservation of energy.
189,"The-loop problem is discussed in greater detail to show how the logic of the loop-the-loop puzzle is surprisingly non-intuitive. The main part of the lecture is an explanation of the nature of the âtrapezoidal queue,â½� a form of counter-terrorism that can be used to deter predators from harming the innocent. The notion of wandering is introduced along with the problems of reconciling two conflicting perspectives: on the one hand, it is easy to wander around the world; on the other hand, the dangers of wandering are dealt with head on.","The lecture begins with a review of the loop-the-loop problem. Professor Shankar then reviews basic terminology in relation to work, kinetic energy and potential energy. He then goes on to define the Work-Energy Theorem. Finally, the Law of Conservation of Energy is discussed and demonstrated with specific examples."
190,"Why is water in the atmosphere not as dense as it is in the oceans. The climate is in some regions where water vapor is mixed up with water vapor to form a solid mass. This produces a pressure gradient, which varies in the direction of the wind. Heat is transferred poleward by the ocean currents in an attempt to balance the atmospheric motion. The change in temperature with height in the air can be reversed by precipitation. Mountain ridges also change the climate with depth in the ocean.","Air is able to hold a limited amount of water vapor, and that amount depends on the temperature of the air. When this saturation vapor pressure is exceeded, liquid water begins to condense and clouds form. There are several different types of clouds, some which rain and others which do not, and each with characteristics specific to it. Vortices are a particular type of cloud phenomenon in which there is a low pressure anomaly in the center of the cloud with rotating air around it, forming funnel clouds as seen in tornados. The low pressure allows liquid water to condense and form the funnel shaped cloud. Haze is another specific type of cloud in which liquid water condenses onto pollution particles in the air."
191,"Therenetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to measure the rotation of winds in the northern and southern hemispheres. In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force acts on the ground to produce a pressure gradient. The gyrefly incident in the equator is caused by a wind stress causing water to pile up in certain areas of the Earth. There is a connection between the physics of hurricanes and hurricanes, and the biological productivity of large chunks of land mass is also discussed.","The atmosphere forces the ocean in three ways: addition and removal of heat, precipitation and evaporation, and wind stress. The former two processes influence the density of sea water. Gravity acts on these density differences to cause large-scale thermohaline currents Wind driven ocean currents are forced by the wind stress acting on the ocean surface which indirectly causes geostrophic currents."
192,"The greenhouse effect in the atmosphere is a dominant mode of mixing. Mixing gases in a confined volume creates a pressure gradient (the same as in the case with wind). The change in temperature with height in the direction of the wind is also discussed. Several examples of this type of mixing are taken into consideration. The second half of the lecture is an introduction to the theory of equilibrium in the overall heat budget of the atmosphere. Mixed gases in the air can be simulated in the form of a âplum-puddingâ over the equator. Finally, the greenhouse effect is introduced and used to illustrate the different ways in which pollutants mix in the climate.","The lapse rate describes the rate at which air cools with altitude. Atmospheric stability depends on the lapse rate. When an air parcel is lifted or lowered, it can continue to rise or descend based on the temperature of the surrounding air at the new altitude, which indicates an unstable atmosphere. Inversions can occur in the atmosphere, meaning the air near the ground will be cooler than air aloft. This type of temperature profile can cause air to be trapped near the Earthâs surface in a boundary layer, which can also lead to pollutants being trapped near the ground."
193,"The atmosphere is composed of gases that are invisible to the human eye. These gases are emitted from the ocean, so water in the atmosphere is inhaled. This vapor gets lighter as it is transported to higher latitudes while losing mass by precipitation. Finally, a scattering problem is discovered on the ocean surface. The discovery of Neptune caused a separation of the atmospheric circulation into three main circulation cells, each transporting fluid over time to the poles.","Pressure and density decrease exponentially with altitude in the atmosphere. This leads to buoyancy effects in the atmosphere when parcels of air are heated or cooled, or raised or lowered in the atmosphere. Temperature varies in a more complicated way with altitude in the atmosphere, with several inversions which occur at the boundaries of the various layers of the atmosphere. Solar radiation interacts differently with the gases that compose each layer of the atmosphere which affects which wavelengths of radiation are able to reach the surface of the Earth."
194,"The atmosphere is composed of gases in the northern and southern hemispheres that are perfectly smooth and equal in all directions. The majority of large-scale motion in the atmosphere is in geostrophic balance, meaning the pressure must be balanced by the Coriolis force acting on the motion. The gyrestatic balance is used to determine the pressure gradient in the overall direction of the atmosphere.","There are other ways in which we can perceive the existence of the atmosphere, predominantly through our perceptions of pressure. Not all planets have atmospheres, and the existence of an atmosphere depends on the ability of gas molecules to remain trapped close to a planet by its gravitational force. The molecular velocity of each gas molecule depends upon its molecular weight, and must exceed the escape velocity of the planet to leave the atmosphere."
195,"Professor United Statesâ political philosophy is the oldest and most fundamental of the social sciences. It is presented in opposition to the Eurocentricism of Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Freud, and others. Political philosophy is not a branch of political science, but an expression of some of the same political principles. The major themes of the course will be the ideas of â½democracy, equality, justice, and fraternity. Professor Gendler goes on to explore some of these elements of political philosophy, such as the notions of consent and responsibility for governing. She concludes by answering several questions from students.","Professor Smith discusses the nature and scope of âpolitical philosophy.â The oldest of the social sciences, the study of political philosophy must begin with the works of Plato and Aristotle, and examine in depth the fundamental concepts and categories of the study of politics. The questions âwhich regimes are best?â and âwhat constitutes good citizenship?â are posed and discussed in the context of Platoâs Apology.Plato,, translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection"
196,"Theobbesâs life and works are discussed, including the Treaty of Westphalia which created a new form of government in opposition to royalism and absolutututism. The concept of universal will is explored in Hobbesian terms, according to which the sovereign is an equal to the sovereign in all of his actions. The lecture concludes with the discussion of Hobbes as a political and intellectual thinker.Thomas Hobbes,, translated with an introduction by Ian JohnstonCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","This is an introduction to the political views of Thomas Hobbes, which are often deemed paradoxical. On the one hand, Hobbes is a stern defender of political absolutism. The Hobbesian doctrine of sovereignty dictates complete monopoly of power within a given territory and over all institutions of civilian or ecclesiastical authority. On the other hand, Hobbes insists on the fundamental equality of human beings. He maintains that the state is a contract between individuals, that the sovereign owes his authority to the will of those he governs and is obliged to protect the interests of the governed by assuring civil peace and security. These ideas have been interpreted by some as indicative of liberal opposition to absolutism.Thomas Hobbes, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection"
197,"The discussion of the Republic continues, focusing on the relationship between philosophy and political life. Socratesâ is the first of a series of lectures on the Republic. The emphasis here is on the idea of freedom of speech, as put forward by John Stuart Mill in his last stanzas. TheÂ Â is then discussed in light of the paradoxical choice of Cato, a liberal thinker who claims to be free from the constraints of state censorship.Plato,, translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","The lecture begins with an explanation of why Platoâs Apology is the best introductory text to the study of political philosophy. The focus remains on the Apology as a symbol for the violation of free expression, with Socrates justifying his way of life as a philosopher and defending the utility of philosophy for political life.Plato,, translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts CollectionPlato, Crito, translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection"
198,"Professor Smith discusses the joint stock corporation, the most important institution in the world economy, was created in 1820s to create an alternative to the traditional one-hour primary of labor. The effort involved to create such a system was faced not only in the form of impressive technical and administrative advances, but also in large urban areas. Such a system would have faced opposition for a number of reasons, including noise and disruption of use of private property. It would also benefit from a public education system that would encourage the emergence of new skills.","Professor Rae explains how the growing scale and complexity of railroads in the US were foundational to the development of modern capitalism. Operating the railroad system required professional managers and new management techniques, and the scale of railroad financing gave rise to the formation of the joint stock corporation. Professor Rae then discusses how different forms of company ownership differ along liability, liquidity, financial scalability, accountability, and role of ownership dimensions. Joint stock corporations are shown to be extremely efficient ways to raise large amounts of money, even if they suffer principal-agent problems."
199,"Professor mortgage law is complex and left without resolution. Typically, the borrower must agree on an interest rate and also on how much collateral he will put up to guarantee repayment. The most important element of the mortgage system is the notion of âklugeâ; that is, the point at which the borrower can choose whether or not to take on a mortgage. The distinction between agent and agent are drawn between the agent and the agent. Then there is consideration of the role of property rights in unlocking the productive power of the market. Property rights are abused in so many ways that it is unclear to what extent the interest rate is an indicator of the real rate of interest.","Professor Rae discusses the subprime mortgage crisis. Major actors are presented and analyzed, including homebuyers, brokers, appraisers, lenders, i-banks, and rating and government agencies. Major actorsâ incentives and risks are assessed. Professor Rae also presents a brief history of government involvement in mortgage markets. Deregulation of the industry and its consequences are explored, and Professor Rae facilitates a discussion on apportioning blame for the collapse of the U.S. housing market."
200,"Professor Rae discusses the Enron business case, about a hedge fund that has been unable to produce an adequate profit margin for its investment. The case, along with other major economic crises of the last three decades, has left a deep imprint in the minds of liberals and some Democrats. Professor Rae explores the notion of the âveggie libelâ in connection with the financial crisis of 2007-09. Posner draws heavily from the mythology of the duke and duchess who were involved in the hunt for the keys to the survival of the American economy. The implication of the story is that the banks were able to rationally solve two problems: adverse selection and moral hazard. According to Alexander, the biggest story in recent economic history is the collapse of the U.S. Treasury which resulted from the same kind of speculative activity: insider information and politicization of public policy.","Jim Alexander, former CFO of the Enron subsidiary Enron Global Power and Pipeline, offers an insiderâs account of Enronâs corporate culture and operations before the companyâs spectacular fall. The leaders of Enron, Mr. Alexander asserts, disregarded concerns over the companyâs ethics. Enron strategically found and exploited loopholes in accounting regulations to make their transactions as opaque as possible. Lack of regulation and oversight allowed Enronâs traders to inflate their numbers. Organizations that were in a position to oversee Enronâs operations sometimes faced grossly misaligned incentives that rewarded negligence. Mr. Alexander emphasizes the notion of the ârational economic manâ in Enronâs corporate culture, and its predominance over notions of ethical corporate behavior."
201,"Professor Smith wrote his best-known work,, in the context of the âworld demographic transition,â½� in which births and deaths rose up from about 2000 to 1,000. He then describes the situation in which the developing world has experienced similar problems, including a decline in life expectancies, low birth and death rates, and a boom in poverty. He ends by discussing the relationship between wealth and inequality, building on Jacob Hackerâs book, The Geography of the Roman Empire, and the importance of theÂ.Alexis de Tocquieu, trans. Henry ReeveElectronic edition deposited and marked-up by ASGRP, the at the University of Virginia, June 1, 1997","Professor Rae introduces Adam Smithâs notion of the âinvisible handâ of the market. Several preconditions must be met for the invisible hand to work. Markets must be open, and there cannot be just one buyer or one seller who can control product prices. No producer can hold a pivotal private technology, and there must be more or less truthful information across the whole market. Governments must enforce property and contracts. However, many of these preconditions are at odds with the Porter Forces, which represent general rules of thumb, or principles, for a firm trying to make above average profits. These principles include avoiding direct competition, establishing high barriers to entry, and avoiding powerful buyers and powerful suppliers. Professor Rae suggests that submission to Adam Smithâs invisible hand may be contrary to basics of corporate strategy. Corporations can leverage powerful political influence to affect the movements of the âinvisible hand.â Guest speaker Jim Alexander, formerly of Enron, discusses problems of very imperfect information, as well as the principal-agent problem. Professor Rae also discusses Adam Smithâs complicated ideas about"
202,"Professoraceful and ambitious Howard Headâs tennis racquets were one of the first for which there is solid documentary evidence. The notion of creative destruction is not an essential characteristic of capitalism; rather, it comes from the perspectives of capitalists and other non-violent leftists. Headâ¶nga describes the evolution of the sport of tennis in the 1970s, from the development of new sportscaves to the rise of anti-modernism in the seventeenth century. The racquet was a reproduction of an ancient form of sport that, while representative of the diverse interests of individuals involved in the sport, was fundamentally shaped by the experience of the early twentieth century.","Professor Rae relates Marxist theories of monopoly capitalism to Schumpeterâs theory of creative destruction. Both Marx and Schumpeter agree that capitalism is a system that is âincapable of standing still,â and is always revising (or revolutionizing) itself. Professor Rae critiques Marxist determinism and other features of Marxâs theories. To highlight Schumpeterian creative destruction, Professor Rae uses examples from technological revolutions in energy production since water-powered mills. Marxâs labor theory of value is discussed. Professor Rae highlights aspects overlooked by Marx, including supply and demand for labor, labor quality, and the role of capital in economic growth. Professor Rae also notes problems with Marxâs predictions, including the prediction that the revolution will occur in the most advanced capitalist economies. Professor Rae also discusses Marxâs theory of the universal class, the end of exploitation, and the withering away of the state."
