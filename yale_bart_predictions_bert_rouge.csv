0,"Professor Mazzotta introduces Dante’s third and final section of Cantos XIX and XXVI. The description of the inner life of the Trinity in XIX is contrasted with the depiction of the Mausoleum in XXVI, where the author falls prey. The figure of the pilgrim encountered in XVIII is identified along with his contemporary Bonaventure. The similarities and differences between the religious perspectives of the Puritans and the mystical traditions of the early seventeenth century are elucidated. The motifs of love and death explored in the circle of knowledge discussed in the previous lecture converge at the numerical center of Canto XIX. Simultaneity in the visual periphery of the celestial rose attests to the strength of Dante‘s political vision.","Professor Mazzotta continues his discussion of the Heaven of the Sun ( X-IV), where the earthly disputes between the Franciscan and Dominican orders give way to mutual praise. The tribute St. Thomas pays to the founder of the Franciscan order ( XI) is repaid by St. Bonaventure through his homage to St. Dominic ( XII). The chiasmic structure of these cantos is reinforced by the presence of Nathan and Joachim of Flora, the counterweights to Solomon and Siger, among the second ring of sages. Special attention is then paid to the lives St. Francis and St. Dominic presented in XI and XII, where the former’s marriage to Lady Poverty finds its poetic counterpart in the latter’s marriage to theology. The critique of the world and its values shared by these religious founders is explored in light of the “ludic theology” that pervades these cantos.",0.8500331044197083,0.8537565469741821,0.846342146396637,0.37878787878787884,0.08396946564885496,0.0,0.2424242424242424,0.2424242424242424
1,"The lecture begins with an introduction to Dante’s. The arts of aesthetics, especially the arts of painting, are discussed. Medieval theories of interpretive reasoning and the so-called liberal arts are also explored. The classical concepts of “rhythmology” and “the art of persuasion” are defined. While mastering these arts is irrelevant to the elect, it is crucial to the development of the liberal arts in the early seventeenth-century poet Zola Lombardo. The final sections of the course conclude with an analysis of some of the principles that Dante derives from his own experiences as a pilgrim.","Professor Mazzotta introduces students to the general scheme and scope of the and to the life of its author. Various genres to which the poem belongs (romance, epic, vision) are indicated, and special attention is given to its place within the encyclopedic tradition. The poem is then situated historically through an overview of Dante’s early poetic and political careers and the circumstances that led to his exile. Professor Mazzotta concludes by discussing the central role Dante’s exile was to play in his poetic project.",0.8530625104904175,0.8529297709465027,0.853195309638977,0.3152173913043479,0.05494505494505494,0.0,0.21739130434782608,0.21739130434782608
2,"The this lecture, Professor Mazzotta returns to the subject of Cantos IV and III. The will is introduced along with two other aspects of Dante’s political maneuver: the freedom of the will in the intellect, and the “right of interpretation.” While the traditionalists claim that the will is not an essential quality of life, Dante perceives it differently. By describing Dante‘s scholastic errors in the previous lecture, he shows how they are applied to problems directly related to his own mortality. In XXVI, Dante moves from the earthly world to the Heaven of the Moon, where the empress Constance is seen as the mediator of all creation. By dramatizing the differences between the moral and ethical perspectives of the shades encountered in XIX, Dante seems to point out that there are many equilibria that can be connected to one another.","This lecture deals with IV, VI and X. At the beginning of IV, the pilgrim raises two questions to which the remainder of the canto is devoted. The first concerns Piccarda ( III) who was constrained to break her religious vows. The second concerns the arrangement of the souls within the stars. The common thread that emerges from Beatrice’s reply is the relationship between intellect and will. Just as Piccarda’s fate reveals the limitations of the will, the representation of the souls in, a condescension to the pilgrim’s human faculty, as Beatrice explains, reveal the limitations of the intellect. By dramatizing the limitations of both faculties, Dante underscores their interdependence. In VI, Dante turns his attention to politics. Through the emperor Justinian’s account of Roman history, Dante places the antithetical views of Virgil and Augustine in conversation. Key to understanding Dante’s position between these two extremes is the vituperation of contemporary civil strife that follows Justinian’s encomium of the Empire. In X, the pilgrim enters the Heaven of the Sun, where St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure introduce him to two rings",0.8465415835380554,0.8514372110366821,0.8417019248008728,0.4268292682926829,0.07975460122699386,0.024691358024691357,0.22560975609756095,0.22560975609756095
3,"Professor this lecture, Professor Mazzotta discusses Ulysses’ transgression ( XXVI-XXVII). The poet’s misreading of the Greek world is discussed in the context of his most famous work,,. U.S. Navy Pier delle Vigne ( XXIV), a highly rated naval purchasing officer in the late medieval and early modern periods. His innovative use of distraction and shock in the depiction of the battle between the Athenians and the Persians is explored further via the visual illusions Dante derives from his experience of the encounter between Statius and Virgil. The presence of the helmet in the circle of the Ionian Bridge is read testament to the divergences of Dante‘s political and social thought.","Professor Mazzotta begins this lecture by recapitulating the ambivalent nature of Ulysses’ sin and its relevance to Dante’s poetic project. XXVII is then read in conjunction with the preceding canto. The antithetical relationship between Dante’s false counselors, Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro, anchors an overarching discussion of the relationship between rhetoric and politics. The latter half of the lecture is devoted to XXVIII, where Dante’s preeminent sower of discord, Bertran de Born, introduces the principle of the. The law of retribution that governs Dante’s Inferno is discussed in light of classical and contemporary theories of justice/crime and punishment. In conclusion, the opening of XXIX is read as a retrospective gloss on the limitations of retributive justice.",0.8518860936164856,0.8503062725067139,0.8534718155860901,0.42060085836909866,0.07792207792207792,0.008733624454148471,0.24892703862660945,0.24892703862660945
4,"Professor this lecture, Professor Mazzotta introduces and proceeds with a close reading of cantos I, II, III. The structure of the is presented and discussed in some detail. The fine line between comedy and tragedy is introduced through Dante’s own examples of thematic similarities and differences. The “pleasure principle” Dante pulls together in his depiction of the journey of the pilgrim across the Sahara desert gains interest in light of his older contemporary, Ulysses. The novelty of the juxtaposition of comedy with tragedy is tied to the ambitions of classical notions of divine foreknowledge and human freedom.","Professor Mazzotta introduces students to the, focusing on the first four cantos of. Stylistic, thematic and formal features of the poem are discussed in the context of its original title,. The first canto is read to establish the double voice of the poet-pilgrim and to contrast the immanent journey with those described by Dante’s literary precursors. Among these is the pilgrim’s guide, Virgil. The following cantos are read with special attention to the ways in which Dante positions his poem vis-à-vis the classical tradition. The novelty of Dante’s otherworldly journey is here addressed in terms of the relationship, introduced in the previous lecture in the context of the, between love and knowledge or, more precisely, between their respective faculties, will and intellect.",0.8665866255760193,0.8701033592224121,0.86309814453125,0.42666666666666664,0.10762331838565022,0.01809954751131222,0.2311111111111111,0.2311111111111111
5,"The this lecture, Professor Mazzotta begins by highlighting the ambiguity of gardens in Canto V. The ambiguity of the garden that conceives of its basic elements is explored in detail through Dante’s own examples of them. The fine line between “spiritedness” Dante draws between his poetic hubris and divine providence is shown to resurface in the circle of sodomy in XIX. The subtle but sharp irony of the juxtaposed poetics of Virgil and Cavalcante in XVI points to the ambiguity prevalent in both cantos XIII and XVII. The presence of the hedges and the occasional sign of treachery in XXVI leads Dante to probe the boundaries of civic justice in XXIV.","This lecture examines IV -VII. Dante’s Limbo, modeled on the classical, is identified as a place of repose and vulnerability. Here, in fact, among the poets of antiquity, the pilgrim falls prey to poetic hubris by joining in their ranks. The pilgrim is faced with the consequences of his poetic vocation when he descends to the circle of lust ( V), where Francesca da Rimini, in her failure to distinguish from reality, testifies to the dangers inherent to the act of reading. From the destructive power of lust within the private world of the court, Dante moves on to the effects of its sister sin, gluttony, on the public sphere of the city. The relationship posited in VI between Ciacco and his native Florence is read as a critique of the “body politic.” In conclusion, Virgil’s discourse on Fortune in the circle of avarice and prodigality ( VII) is situated within the Christian world of divine providence.",0.8451528549194336,0.8440696001052856,0.846238911151886,0.4014869888475836,0.09737827715355804,0.015094339622641511,0.2304832713754647,0.2304832713754647
6,"The Gospel of Mark is a gospel dramatically different from the Gospels. It is full of long dialogues, it speaks of “signs” rather than exorcisms, and its narrative differs at many points from the published texts. Mark is also a passion narrative with an extended introduction to the issues of Jesus’ Jewish piety. The questions of how Jesus would appear in the Jerusalem marketplace are then expounded upon. Mark’s ascetic attitude towards women is explored in the second half of the Gospel.","The Gospels of the New Testament are not biographies, and, in this class, they are read through a historical critical lens. This means that the events they narrate are not taken at face value as historical. The Gospel of Mark illustrates how the gospel writer skillfully crafts a narrative in order to deliver a message. It is a message that emphasizes a suffering messiah, and the necessity of suffering before glory. The gospel’s apocalyptic passages predict troubles for the Jewish temple and incorporate this prediction with its understanding of the future coming of the Son of Man.",0.8632980585098267,0.8665433526039124,0.8600770235061646,0.3867403314917128,0.08938547486033518,0.022598870056497175,0.1988950276243094,0.1988950276243094
7,"The rise of institutionalism in the New Testament can be understood in terms of the letters of Apostle Paul and Ignatius. In 1 Corinthians, the reader is shown to interpret the text as a collection of historical documents rather than a single, unified group of individuals. How did this process come about? Different approaches were taken at different times, including the traditional method of interpretation of the text in 2 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians. Finally, the Letters to the Colossians shows how these attitudes came to be predominant in early Christianity.","The Epistle of Jude can be dated to somewhere during post-apostolic Christianity and before the formation of the Canon. It refers to the apostles as representing a prior generation, yet it quotes from texts later excluded (perhaps, for example, by 2 Peter) from the Canon. The letters of Ignatius of Antioch contain evidence of a move toward the institutionalization of early Christianity. It mentions, for example, three different church offices: bishops, presbyters, and deacons. It also heavily emphasizes the authority held by those with these titles. The contains liturgical and ritual instructions for rites such as baptism, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Eucharist. All these documents show the change in early Christianity toward greater church structure and institutionalization.",0.8508814573287964,0.8597205281257629,0.8422222137451172,0.35071090047393366,0.06698564593301436,0.019323671497584544,0.2274881516587678,0.2274881516587678
8,"The Gospel of John is the highest form of Christianity. It seems to be written for the sake of bringing together different people from different backgrounds, cultures, and traditions. In order to differentiate the Gospel from the texts that were written in the early church, the author must carefully consider the attitudes of those around Jesus. This involves a close reading of the letter to the Romans which shows how the author attempts to explain the change in doctrine.","The Jesus of the Gospel of John often speaks in riddles so that his dialogues with characters such as Nicodemus appear confusing, rather than clarifying. The focus, however, of the Gospel of John is on Christology. In the Gospel, Jesus is divine. So it is also in 1 John, where many of the themes of the Gospel are echoed. 1, 2, and 3 John possibly present us with correspondences of the Johannine community, a sectarian group insisting on the divinity and humanity of Jesus, against the Docetists and other differing forms of early Christianity.",0.8559455871582031,0.8599088191986084,0.8520187139511108,0.35838150289017345,0.0935672514619883,0.03550295857988166,0.20809248554913296,0.20809248554913296
9,"The New Testament contains some of the most pernicious passages that seem to contradict each other in their depiction of the world. The book of Revelation is especially vivid because it shows how the author of the text attacks the values of the ancient Near Eastern religions and moves from one culture to another, building up to the next. Revelation also presents a pro-natal message for those who are involved in the work.","The Apocalypse of John showed an anti-Roman, politically revolutionary perspective. This is in contrast with Paul’s writing in Romans 13, which calls for submission to governmental authorities - although passages in 1 Corinthians may be said to contradict this. 2 Thessalonians, a pseudonymous letter, also preaches a politically conservative and accommodative message, as does 1 Peter. Interestingly, these letters do not discard or ignore apocalypticism but use it quite differently from the author of Revelation to further their message of political conservatism. 2 Peter seems to be a letter dating from the second century, from the post-apostolic age. In 2 Peter, the apocalypse is no longer imminent and is not used to further any admonition. Instead, it has become simply a part of Christian doctrine.",0.8392490148544312,0.8449178338050842,0.833655595779419,0.2885572139303483,0.05025125628140704,0.01015228426395939,0.1492537313432836,0.1492537313432836
10,"In this lecture, Professor Hayes continues to discuss women’s role in the ancient world. Through a comparative analysis of the Bible, she demonstrates how both methods of interpreting the Bible are historically accurate and historical critical. The issues raised in the pastoring of the Jerusalem Temple is also discussed, including whether one is able to read the Bible as a means of “transition” or a way for conversion. In the second half of the lecture, the topic of gender in the New Testament is expounded upon.","There are many ways of interpreting the text, and ancient methods of interpretation may seem bizarre to our modern sensibilities. The New Testament offers us many examples of how an early Christian might interpret the text of the Hebrew Bible, which was their scripture. The Letter to the Hebrews, which is not really a letter but a speech of encouragement, structures its argument around the thesis that Jesus’ liturgy and priesthood is superior to that in the Hebrew Bible. The author of Hebrews proves this through several interesting interpretations of passages from the Hebrew Bible.",0.8546421527862549,0.8552339673042297,0.8540510535240173,0.4065934065934066,0.07777777777777778,0.033707865168539325,0.21978021978021975,0.21978021978021975
11,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the chronological order of the Hebrew Bible. He begins with an overview of the books Ezra and Nehemiah that first appeared in the Greek world in the fifth century BCE. Then he describes the development of cities in Egypt and Syria that eventually turned into great cities of power and wealth. Alexander the Great established three major empires: the Persian Empire, the Seleucids, and the Avars. All these expansions took place in step with the expansion of the classical Greek world. Their expansion would continue to expand until the middle of the seventh century when the Arab conquest of Jerusalem was complete. Professor Freedmen ends the lecture with a discussion of the Mosaic Temple at Jerusalem.","Of the four kingdoms that arose after Alexander’s death, those of the Seleucids and the Ptolemies are most pertinent to an understanding of the New Testament. Especially important is the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who forced the issue of Hellenism in Jerusalem by profaning the temple. Jews were not alike in their reaction to Hellenization, but a revolt arose under the leadership of the Mattathias and his sons, who would rule in the Hasmonean Dynasty. After the spread of Roman rule, the Judea was under client kings and procurators until the Jewish War and the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. Revolt was only one Jewish response to foreign rule; another was apocalypticism, as we see in Daniel and also in the Jesus’ teaching and the early Christian movement.",0.8454377055168152,0.8517971038818359,0.8391725420951843,0.36220472440944884,0.08730158730158731,0.016,0.1968503937007874,0.1968503937007874
12,"The this lecture, a reflection on the prophetic books of the Former Prophets and the Book of Job. The book is divided into three main branches: prophetic literature, which seeks to reach the numerical center of the universe through the use of mythological figures (including God’s prophet Zephaniah) and prophetic literature (anachronism). Both types of prophetic literature are associated with their themes of divine providence and consolation. At the end of the lecture, the book discusses the predictions of the Fall that were made in 532-565. The predictions included an increase in inventiveness among the gentiles and a decrease in mortality. Their predictions were followed by a rise in religious practice across the Mediterranean world. The third section of the Hebrew Bible is presented as an alternative to the conventional book of Jeremiah.","The destruction of Jerusalem challenged the faith of the nation. What was the meaning of this event and how could such tremendous evil and suffering be reconciled with the nature of God himself? Professor Hayes shows how Israel’s prophets attempted to answer this question, turning the nation’s defeat and despair into an occasion for renewing faith in Israel’s God. The lecture continues with an in-depth study of the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel’s denunciations of Jerusalem are among the most lurid and violent in the Bible and he concludes that destruction is the only possible remedy. Ezekiel’s visions include God’s withdrawal from Jerusalem to be with his people in exile, and his ultimate return. Ezekiel’s use of dramatic prophetic signs, his rejection of collective divine punishment and assertion of individual responsibility are discussed. The last part of the lecture turns to Second Isaiah and the famous “servant songs” that find a universal significance in Israel’s suffering.",0.8495330810546875,0.8462442755699158,0.8528475165367126,0.3812709030100334,0.08754208754208755,0.020338983050847456,0.20066889632107024,0.20066889632107024
13,"The this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the developments that occurred after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple and the national basis of their society. The Deuteronomist blames the sin of idolatry on the loss of the temple to the Assyrians. The second half of the lecture focuses on the issue of accountability in the face of external catastrophies. An alternative interpretation is offered by the scholarly group of “judges” who were judged by their views on responsibility for the miseries of other nations. The final part of the course turns to the lengthy book of 2 Kings which contains some of the most pernicious passages from the Bible. The books of 1 and 2 Kings are introduced and the moral fabric of the Hebrew Bible is expounded upon.",This lecture concludes the discussion of the Deuteronomistic historian’s efforts to show that idolatry and associated sins lead to God’s wrath and periods of trouble. The remainder of the lecture is an introduction to the phenomenon of Israelite prophecy which included ecstatic prophecy and prophetic guilds. The non-literary prophets of the historical books of the Bible and their various roles (as God’s zealot; as conscience of the king) are examined.,0.8717586398124695,0.8676264882087708,0.8759304285049438,0.36633663366336633,0.12,0.010101010101010102,0.24752475247524752,0.24752475247524752
14,"The covenantal details in the Hebrew Bible are presented and the covenantal stipulations (JE laws) are introduced. The covenantal core of the Bible is then incorporated into the Other Covenant (or “Crazy Jane” Law), which relates the laws of Israel to the cultures of the Former Prophets. The latter four incorporate elements of ancient Near Eastern legal traditions, such as Zephaniah, Yehezkel Kaufmann, and the Holiness Code, to form a formal community that conforms to the exilic perspectives of the Deuteronomistic School. At Sinai, the Judean exiles were included in a new covenant called the Covenant of Nahum, which laid out the Mosaic code of ethics and their structure. Exodus concludes with the lengthy book of Jeremiah.","This lecture introduces biblical law in a comparative approach that identifies similarities and differences between Israelite law and other Ancient Near Eastern legal traditions, such as the Code of Hammurabi.

15,"The this lecture, Moses returns to Egypt after a battle of wills between Yahweh and Moses in which Moses is defeated. Moses’s description of the causes of the second plague (Homer) and the reasons behind its success are explained. The third plague is introduced with an analysis of three different aspects of the text: it is introduced as an expression of God’S covenant with Israel; it is presented as an alternative to the traditional method of interpretation of the Bible; it involves the repeated appearance of antiseptic material from the original source (i.e. cloth-making). Moses also comments on the motifs of angelic bodies that appear in the Hebrew Bible. Exodus concludes with the story of the binding of the Israelites for sacrifice.","This lecture traces the account of the Exodus (and the origin of the Passover festival as a historicization of older nature festivals) and Israel’s liberation from bondage under Pharaoh. The story reaches its climax with the covenant concluded between God and Israel through Moses at Sinai. Drawing heavily on the work of Jon Levenson, the lecture examines Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the Sinaitic covenant and describes the divine-human relationship (an intersection of law and love) that the covenant seeks to express.",0.8528449535369873,0.8516128063201904,0.8540806770324707,0.3904761904761904,0.08653846153846154,0.0,0.21904761904761902,0.21904761904761902
16,"The this lecture, the second half of the course turns to the creation account that relates the exploits of a Sumerian king to an interpretation of the biblical Bible. The basic elements of the two accounts are shown to converge at the numerical center of the story, where the wicked Assyrians repent and are spared divine punishment. The story is then woven together into three narratives that conform to the exilic perspectives of the Hebrew Bible: Exodus (570), the story of the binding of the harlot, and the book of Nahum Sarna (1679). Both narratives differ very little from the classical concepts of justice and goodness. However, their narrative differs markedly from the modern ones in their depiction of the Fall and is distinctly Greek.","This lecture continues the discussion on Genesis, including the familiar accounts of Cain and Abel, the Flood and Noahide covenant. The story of Cain and Abel expresses the notion of the God-endowed sanctity of human life and a “universal moral law” governing the world. Examination of the contradictions and doublets in the flood story leads to a discussion of the complex composition and authorship of the Pentateuch. These features as well as anachronisms challenge traditional religious convictions of Moses as the author of the first five books of the Bible.",0.8499864935874939,0.8463923931121826,0.8536112308502197,0.35185185185185186,0.09345794392523366,0.009433962264150943,0.2592592592592593,0.2592592592592593
17,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on the Montgomery bus boycott, the 1965 race riot that killed dozens of African American women in Selma, Alabama. The second half of the lecture focuses on some critical aspects of the 1964 Civil Rights movement, including the elimination of blacks as a voting class. The movement also includes an awareness of the role of women in the larger struggle for freedom and equality. In the second portion of the course, Prof. Holloway discusses some of the key concepts that have been explored over the centuries to understand the movement. For example, the tactics employed by the Black Panthers were often racially influenced, targeting whites as well as African Americans. In all cases, the rhetoric associated with the campaign has been hyperbolic, making it easy to misinterpret the movement as an expression of black political and social anxiety.","Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement have become embodied in each other. But in this lecture, Professor Holloway asks: what of the other activists in the struggle? What of the other organizations involved in the struggle? And what of the history of the struggle before King reluctantly emerged on the scene? By uncovering the histories of the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, the death of Emmett Till, the Greensboro student sit-ins, and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one finds differing responses to violence and multiple approaches to attacking racial bias and discrimination. Professor Holloway also draws attention to the gender dynamics of the civil rights movement by considering the inner-workings of the Women’s Political Council in Montgomery, Alabama, the original motivating force behind the 1955 bus boycott, and the great importance of respectability to the movement. This lecture reveals that there was no single civil rights movement, that there were many activists working in a variety of different ways and with varying degrees of success, and that King was a complicated figure, both inspiring and stifling activism.",0.8539005517959595,0.86369788646698,0.8443230390548706,0.38483965014577254,0.11730205278592375,0.04129793510324484,0.22740524781341107,0.22740524781341107
18,"Professor this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the specifics of race in American history. He focuses on the Bush-Dukakis campaign, the impact of his election in 1988, and the way that his victory in the presidential election tainted racial discourse. In the second portion of the lecture, he looks at the three forms of political strategy that emerged in the wake of the Willie Horton advertisement: the one that ran for the White House in 1988; the one introduced in the Senate in 1988 by John C. Fremont (a Korean shopkeeper from South Central, Indiana), the one presented in the ad. At the same time, the rhetoric about race was becoming more recognizable and more relevant to African Americans. As a result, people began to seriously consider the possibility of race being used as a weapon in everyday life.","In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses how race influenced public policy by examining some of the key cultural symbols of the past few decades, all in an effort to answer the question: how is race used in our society? Professor Holloway discusses Bill Clinton’s policies in particular, honing in on his ability to connect with the African American community, the controversy surrounding Lani Guinier’s cabinet appointment, and his National Dialogue on Race. He then turns to California to examine the passage of Propositions 187 and 209, which begin to call into question common notions about civil rights legislation and affirmative action in our nation. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway talks about four landmark court cases–,,, and –to shed light on the way race began to operate in a legal setting, as well as the general dumbing down of discourse in politics and media about race, in the post-civil rights era.",0.8626170754432678,0.8612246513366699,0.8640139698982239,0.37966101694915255,0.10921501706484642,0.027491408934707907,0.2033898305084746,0.2033898305084746
19,"Professor this lecture on African culture, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Marcus Garvey and Homi K. Merton. The complicated texture of the African scene that defined the early part of the nineteenth century is considered. While the poem begins with an exploration of the naturalism of Africa’s naturalism, it moves on to explore the more urbanized aspects of black life. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Fry examines some of the ways that the early modernists and early Modernists understood the world in terms of their similarities and differences. The notion of “the sound of sense” is explored in the context of the Harlem Renaissance.","The Harlem Renaissance brought together legions of black writers, artists, musicians, and intellectuals who celebrated black culture and romanticized its connections to an African past. In this lecture, Professor Holloway documents some of the expressions of the Harlem Renaissance (also known as the New Negro Renaissance), the political and cultural movement that claimed Harlem as its figurative capital. In fact, thousands of African Americans flocked to Harlem, and it became the center of a rich cultural and political environment–one always fraught with complications, but still understood to represent the best that black America had to offer. As Professor Holloway shows, white enthusiasts of these newly-admired cultural forms visited Harlem to get a taste of black life. Indeed, without the financial support of the white community, whatever cultural efflorescence that did exist in Harlem would have been significantly less grand. Yet the tensions between white patrons and black artists, as well as between black intellectuals and black artists, made the Harlem Renaissance a complex movement.",0.8435046672821045,0.8473025560379028,0.8397406339645386,0.32608695652173914,0.07299270072992702,0.029411764705882353,0.19565217391304346,0.19565217391304346
20,"The this lecture, Professor Holloway traces the development of the New Negro mentality in the second half of World War I. The New Negroes were first formed in the trenches during World War II as African Americans prepared to fight alongside whites in the occupation. As civilian administrators came to replace military personnel in the new militancy, they began to seriously consider the possibility of black citizenship. In the end, the new group was able to make an army of their political and social grievances against the new policemen who beat them. During this time, it became clear that people were prepared to enlarge the gap between white and black citizens. Thus, the violence that summer in Chicago, in particular, was a form of racial violence, one that not only resulted in the persecution of African Americans, but also increased threats to their national well-being. As Professor Holloways reveals, this new kind of violence took place in the form of gerrymandering, similar to the ones pioneered by Booker T. Washington in the early 1920s.","In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the New Negro mentality, a new black consciousness forged out of political and economic frustration and the cultural shocks of the Great Migration. The New Negro ideology was articulated on a wide scale after World War I, when the promises of democracy at home went unfulfilled. Marcus Garvey best articulated this new consciousness through his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the first organized grassroots mass protest movement in African American history. Garvey advocated black pride and autonomy, worked to build a great steam line so blacks could partake in nation-building, and helped dispirited blacks dream of an eventual return to Africa. Garvey’s ability to realize his dreams was limited by his own organizational ineptitude and by the federal government’s systematic attempts to infiltrate and then destroy the UNIA. The lecture ends with an examination of Garvey’s relationships to other black leaders, including Father Divine and his Peace Mission Movement.",0.855871856212616,0.8597711324691772,0.8520077466964722,0.31137724550898205,0.08433734939759037,0.03636363636363636,0.19760479041916168,0.19760479041916168
21,"Professor this lecture, Professor Blight focuses on the three so-called Reconstruction Amendments, the Emancipation Proclamation and the Freedman’s Bureau bill. After laying out the roots of Reconstruction in the Reconstruction South, Blight turns to the notion of free will as a means to “rewrites” individual behavior. The passage of the Freedmen’S Bureau bill radically altered the way people were treated. In 1868, the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress passed the 15th Amendment which outlawed slavery in the United States. The new radical measures introduced in 1868 marked the official end of Reconstruction. After months of political maneuvering, the Civil War began when Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, in the harbor outside Charleston, SC. Despite their violent campaign of white violence, right-wing factions in the military and among the electorate remained committed to staying the course.","Between 1865 and 1877, several plans were developed by which the Confederate states could be readmitted to the Union and the residents of the states given full citizenship rights. It was far from clear, however, which plan would do a better job maintaining the social peace and protecting African Americans’ ability to earn a wage, raise a family, own land, and exercise the right to vote. In this lecture, Professor Holloway outlines the contours of the Ten Percent Plan, Presidential Reconstruction, and Radical Reconstruction, and he explains how these plans embraced a variety of approaches to reuniting the disparate states. As Professor Holloway explains, Reconstruction greatly enhanced the rights of African Americans, while also circumscribing their lives by new political, economic, and social initiatives.",0.846488356590271,0.8454898595809937,0.8474892377853394,0.2889733840304183,0.03831417624521073,0.007722007722007722,0.14448669201520914,0.14448669201520914
22,"Professor this lecture, Professor Blight discusses some of the main themes of the course. Freedom, equality, and “cruel mockery” are defined through Frederick Douglass’s 1854 speech, “What hast thou?” Professor Blayfessel traces the ways that freedom and equality were intertwined in the early phases of the Civil War. The second half of the lecture focuses on the ideas of freedom and emancipation before shifting to the notions of “right” to citizenship. The lecture concludes with an analysis of two Supreme Court decisions that outlawed slavery in the United States.","In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a brief summary of what was happening in the decades leading up to the Civil War, including the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scott decision, and John Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry. He discusses the Civil War, focusing specifically on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Conscription Acts of 1863. Professor Holloway spends the duration of the lecture focusing on the labor and racial tensions that led to the New York City draft riots and their aftermath. The crucible of the Civil War, he argues, gives a very clear picture of what it means to be a citizen and what it means to be American. Professor Holloway then gives specific examples of how citizenship was linked to freedom, how freedom was linked to race, and how the tensions between these linkages produced extreme violence.",0.8616676926612854,0.8662338852882385,0.8571494817733765,0.3755458515283843,0.10572687224669604,0.062222222222222213,0.22707423580786026,0.22707423580786026

Two explanatory hypotheses are proposed: one is that the universe is comprised of dark material rather than dark energy; the second is that dark energy is comprised by the mixing of two galaxies (Marsyas and galaxies) that scientists have attempted to identify through gravitational lenses. The results of these experiments reveal the extent to which dark energy has been transferred to the universe over time.","In this third of three update lectures, Prof. Bailyn provides new information pertaining to the third part of the course, on cosmology.

Finally, the unsolved problem of dark matter is addressed and the possibility of detecting the presence of more mass is addressed.","Class begins with clarification of equations from the previous lecture. Four post-Newtonian gravitational effects are introduced and discussed in detail. The first of these is the so-called Perihelion Precession, which occurs when the major axis of a planet’s elliptical orbit precesses within its orbital plane, in response to changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. Secondly, deflection of light is described as the curving of light as it passes near a large mass.

28,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines the developments that took place after the Peloponnesian War. He argues that the Athenians should make an alliance of their own to deter the Spartans from quitting the war. After this fact, the Spartan general Lysander at Issus was defeated in the battle of Leuctra. In response to this defeat, Athens sends two more ships to fight each other in the Battle of Sybota. These four ships were the first in a line of attack on the Athenian side. The Athenians then rout the Spartans in the hoplite battle. On the way, they decided to take the battle to the Corcyraeans. However, this decision was not enough to save the Greek army from collapse. So, we return to the discussion of the Athenic wars.","In this lecture, Professor Kagan focuses on the causes of the Peloponnesian War and the possible motivations for Thucydides’ book,. Concerning the first point, Professor Kagan parts ways with Thucydides and argues that the war was not inevitable and that the Athenians under Pericles followed a policy of deterrence, which was aimed at peace. Similarly, he points out that there were a number of Spartans who did not want war as well. Therefore, according to this line of reasoning, war broke out due to a number of factors that were avoidable. Concerning the second point, Professor Kagan argues that Thucydides was a revisionist historian. In other words, Thucydides was writing not as a disinterested historian, but as a historian with a point to make, namely, that the war was inevitable and that Athens was only a democracy in name under Pericles. Finally, Professor Kagan acknowledges that his two points are debatable.",0.8465840220451355,0.8490530252456665,0.8441292643547058,0.3416370106761566,0.11469534050179211,0.04332129963898917,0.20640569395017797,0.20640569395017797

He also points out that there were many elements of Greek life that were separate from that of the West. In addition, he intimates that the Greeks were closely related to the great powers of the aristocracy. Finally, he comments on the possibility of studying the history of the common man as a historian.","Professor Donald Kagan explains why people should study the ancient Greeks. He argues that the Greeks are worthy of our study not only because of their vast achievements and contributions to Western civilization (such as in the fields of science, law, and politics) but also because they offer a unique perspective on humanity. To the Greeks, man was both simultaneously capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes; he was both great and important, but also mortal and fallible. He was a tragic figure, powerful but limited. Therefore, by studying the Greeks, one gains insight into a tension that has gripped and shaped the West and the rest of the world through its influence.

30,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan traces the development of the Athenian Empire. He also points out that the Athenians were able to make gains in defeating the Persians and keeping them financially afloat. After this fact, the Greek world began to experience a decline in naval power. The Athenians thought that it could improve their naval abilities and increase their political standing. However, according to early Athenian accounts, this process took place within the dynamics of warfare. Eventually, the Greeks under the leadership of Mycenaean Athens decided to aid the Persian invaders in exchange for a reward. Athens was unable to advance this arrangement and the Athenos collapsed into the pit of Hell.","In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the mechanics of the Delian League and its transformation into the Athenian empire. This transformation caused Athens to rival Sparta as an equal in power and prestige. He also argues that this process took place rather smoothly due to the good relations between Sparta and Athens. Professor Kagan argues that Cimon the Athenian generally played an important part in this development.

32,"Theiverging significantly from Marx’s notion of the capitalist mode of production, Weber argues that the capitalist system is characterized by different modes of thought. Leaders strive to “take the place of the soul” in society, they attempt to legitimate their uses of the word. Through a closer look at the works of major twentieth-century theorists, including Nietzsche, Freud, Weber and Weber, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of two seminal Marx and Freud. The novelty of the concept of autonomous persons is tied with the ambitions of the young Marx, who breaks with Hegelian laws of emancipation.","Today we take a bridge into the twentieth century, constructed by Nietzsche, Freud, and Weber’s critical theory. Each author is different in important ways, but they also agree on two crucial points: we must subject our consciousness and assumptions to critical scrutiny and, along with increasing liberation and rationalization in some ways, modern society also has repressive elements. Nietzsche is the oldest of these thinkers; he dies in 1900 and stops working a decade before due to mental illness. While he was ill, his sister, a proto-Nazi and associate of Hitler, cared for him. Her control of his papers and how they were released to the public painted him as a proto-Nazi himself, but reading his whole oeuvre illuminates that Nietzsche subjected Judaism and Christianity to the same scrutiny. In, Nietzsche attempts to use the genealogy method to be critical of modern morality without taking a certain vantage point.

33,"Theiverging significantly from Marx’s idea of morality in the genealogical method, Freud asserts that all moralities, all conceptions of good and evil are created by the process of representing good values. The concept of “good” is defined through the use of examples from various types of sources. A distinction is made between “what is good” and “ what is bad.” Freud’S conception of goodness is presented in contrast to the modernist view. At the end of the lecture, Freud offers a way of defining good as evil.","Freud’s brand of critical theory adds important dimensions; he argues that we can better understand our consciousness through the process of psychoanalysis–the talking cure, dream work, etc–and we can cure ourselves through this process as well. We discuss Freud’s early days in Vienna developing psychoanalysis as a clinical approach alongside Jung, Ferenczi, and others in their tight-knit circle. They develop the ideas of the id, ego, and superego as well as the antithetical drives, the love drive (Eros) and the death drive (Thanatos). Later, Freud applies these concepts to society as a whole in his books, and.

35,"The discussion of suicide continues. A number of different theories are attempted to explain how a suicide is approached by different people. One is the loss of an individual’s right to die; another is the right to refuse to die. A third involves the possibility that one cannot know the future with certainty. A fourth involves the question “what does it take to die?” To conclude, Professor Gendler discusses two possible ways in which thinking about suicide is affected by social considerations. A fifth involves considering the social circumstances of someone committing suicide. The course ends with a question-and-answer session during which students inquire about some implications of the study.","Durkheim’s is a foundational text for the discipline of sociology, and, over a hundred years later, it remains influential in the study of suicide. Durkheim’s study demonstrates that what is thought to be a highly individual act is actually socially patterned and has social, not only psychological, causes. Durkheim’s study uses the logic of multivariate statistical analysis, which is now widely used in the discipline of sociology. Durkheim considered factors including country, marital status, religion, and education level to explain variations in suicide rates. Durkheim found that Protestants, who tended to be more highly educated, had a higher rate of suicide than Catholics, who tended to have lower levels of education. Jewish people fell outside of this pattern; highly educated, they had a very low rate of suicide. Durkheim explained that the education of Protestants led them to individual consciousness whereas the education of Jewish people meant to make them more integrated into their religious community.

36,"Theiverging significantly from Marx’s theories of alienation and exploitation, the course looks at the development of new forms of capitalist activity within the capitalist system. Marx argues that the emergence of different forms of capitalism in the early twentieth century raised issues about what constitutes a “middle class.” He also points out that the middle classes produced children in greater numbers than in other members of the lower orders. In order to differentiate between these different types of production methods, young workers have to focus their resources on fewer jobs and fewer opportunities to participate in the workforce. To understand capitalism, he examines the ideas of free will and marketris, including an analysis of the movement towards higher education. He ends by suggesting that the modern concept of ‘middle class’ is characterized by different kinds of development.","Along with the macro-level shift from traditional forms of authority to legal-rational authority, Weber’s theory of class identifies a macro-level shift from status to class determining life chances. In feudal times, under traditional forms of authority, monarchs or others in power conferred high status upon individuals and material wealth followed; first a man would be named a nobleman, and then he would get his estate. In the modern capitalist era, individuals obtain their monetary or material wealth and their class position vis-à-vis the market determines their life chances. Weber, in contrast to Marx, argues that class is a modern phenomenon. However, this does not mean that our modern and contemporary world does not have versions of status. Like remnants of traditional and charismatic authority co-mingled with legal-rational authority in the state and other institutions, status still determines life chances to a certain extent. The influence of status is somewhat subsumed under Weber’s category of social class.",0.8421167731285095,0.8478072881698608,0.8365020751953125,0.2913907284768212,0.06666666666666665,0.013422818791946308,0.15231788079470202,0.15231788079470202
37,"Professoriverging significantly from the purest type of legal-rational authority, Weber argues that there are different ways of defining and defining a culture. Different types of legal rules are introduced and discussed in greater detail. The concept of freedom is defined as an expression of one’s right to freedom. However, the concept of autonomous authority is not always free of flaws and can be simplified into two or more levels of authority. We will look at the example of a “good government” in Bolivia during the Second World War. In the second half of the lecture we turn to a discussion of the role of religion in the development of capitalism.","The purest form–the ideal type–of Weber’s legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens or clients alike.",0.848027765750885,0.8484545350074768,0.8476014137268066,0.39473684210526316,0.07964601769911506,0.008928571428571428,0.24561403508771928,0.24561403508771928
38,"The concept of entropy is introduced through the Boltzmann factor, which gives a number of different structures in a single atom. Boltzman factor is introduced along with the microscopic meaning of the entropy. The Boltzman factor is derived from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant and is used to explain the irreversibility of tops and prospects of objects in circular motion. Several alternative arrangements of cyclohexane are computed and one can calculate the entropy change for a given number of atoms. The uncertainty principle is shown to arise from the fact that Newton’s laws forbid certain types of nucleophiles from being bosons or fermions. The calculated entropy change due to the tilt of the rotation axis is derived.Professor McBride”s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","After discussing the statistical basis of the law of mass action, the lecture turns to developing a framework for understanding reaction rates. A potential energy surface that associates energy with polyatomic geometry can be realized physically for a linear, triatomic system, but it is more practical to use collective energies for starting material, transition state, and product, together with Eyring theory, to predict rates. Free-radical chain halogenation provides examples of predicting reaction equilibria and rates from bond dissociation energies.

39,The formation of molecular orbitals is discussed in greater detail. The concepts of “base” and “signify” are introduced. Angular velocity in the gas phase is derived using the same techniques as in the atomic orbitals of ammonia and methanol. The field due to an “initial kinematics” that can be visualized by x-ray diffraction reveals a low electron density contour for both organic molecules and their associated gases.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008),"This lecture begins by applying the united-atom “plum-pudding” view of molecular orbitals, introduced in the previous lecture, to more complex molecules. It then introduces the more utilitarian concept of localized pairwise bonding between atoms. Formulating an atom-pair molecular orbital as the sum of atomic orbitals creates an electron difference density through the cross product that enters upon squaring a sum. This “overlap” term is the key to bonding. The hydrogen molecule is used to illustrate how close a simple sum of atomic orbitals comes to matching reality, especially when the atomic orbitals are allowed to hybridize.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)",0.8655385375022888,0.872608482837677,0.8585821986198425,0.4064171122994653,0.14054054054054055,0.07650273224043715,0.26737967914438504,0.26737967914438504

He describes how AstraZeneca and omeprazole became commercially important pharmaceutical companies after they discovered that their stereochemistry could not be used for stereochemistry. The latter was unable to advance due to competition from other chemists in the field. Professor Barron then describes the development of nomenclature, notation, and molecular models closely related to those in use today. He also discusses the FDA’s approval process for biotechnology, which uses only single enantiomers to create “single enantiomeric” molecules.Professor McBride‘s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","After mentioning some legal implications of chirality, the discussion of configuration concludes using esomeprazole as an example of three general methods for producing single enantiomers. Conformational isomerism is more subtle because isomers differ only by rotation about single bonds, which requires careful physico-chemical consideration of energies and their relation to equilibrium and rate constants. Conformations have their own notation and nomenclature. Curiously, the barrier to rotation about the C-C bond of ethane was established by measuring its heat capacity.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)",0.8538267016410828,0.8553810119628906,0.8522780537605286,0.374384236453202,0.11940298507462686,0.08040201005025124,0.22660098522167485,0.22660098522167485
41,"Professor organic isomerism begins with the synthesis of -hydroxypropionic acid by Liebig in 1858. The structure and chemical activity of these acids are still very separate from their stereochemistry. Artificial or natural isomers (ionuclides) can be driven to form “optically active” molecules that have the same structural characteristic as isomeric isomers. The process of forming an artificial isomer through a combination of the two isomers is introduced along with the competition between Baeyer’s wire mother/cloth mother method and those of Barthes’. The latter method was validated experimentally by Bürgi and Dunitz, who compared numerous biological elements including borane and diols. The latter phase of the development of titanium-based pharmaceuticals achieved notable success but was not free of flaws and missing catalysts.Professor McBride website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","With his tetrahedral carbon models van’t Hoff explained the mysteries of known optical isomers possessing stereogenic centers and predicted the existence of chiral allenes, a class of molecules that would not be observed for another sixty-one years.

42,The dynamics is discussed in greater detail and field due to differences in the density of the molecules in the solution. The energies of the single minimum and the no-nodes in the second half are derived. The latter is due to the fact that the solutions described in this lecture focus on “the probability density” rather than the actual probability density. The slippery concept of “rotating” is introduced through a variety of problems. The first half of this lecture looks at bonding in two dimensions: one-dimensional space and time. The second half looks at the possibility of homologation by looking at the shape of an object in a box.,"After showing how a double-minimum potential generates one-dimensional bonding, Professor McBride moves on to multi-dimensional wave functions. Solving Schrödinger’s three-dimensional differential equation might have been daunting, but it was not, because the necessary formulas had been worked out more than a century earlier in connection with acoustics. Acoustical “Chladni” figures show how nodal patterns relate to frequencies. The analogy is pursued by studying the form of wave functions for “hydrogen-like” one-electron atoms. Removing normalizing constants from the formulas for familiar orbitals reveals the underlying simplicity of their shapes.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)",0.8356135487556458,0.8427014350891113,0.8286439180374146,0.19354838709677422,0.009302325581395349,0.0,0.11981566820276499,0.11981566820276499
43,"The a century before Lavoisier was discovered, the discipline of organic nomenclature was introduced. The structure of nitrous acid and its biosynthesis became key concepts in organic chemistry. The “Chemical Revolution” began with the discovery of oxygenation in the 1970s, but broadened to include the spectroscopy and chemical transformation of organic molecules. Lavoisiers’ book describes the process by which reaction occurs in solution through the passage of a set of “virgin soil” molecules through the silyl ethers that creates an artificial rose.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","This lecture traces the development of elemental analysis as a technique for the determination of the composition of organic compounds beginning with Lavoisier’s early combustion and fermentation experiments, which showed a new, if naïve, attitude toward handling experimental data. Dalton’s atomic theory was consistent with the empirical laws of definite, equivalent, and multiple proportions. The basis of our current notation and of precise analysis was established by Berzelius, but confusion about atomic weight multiples, which could have been clarified early by the law of Avogadro and Gay-Lussac, would persist for more than half a century.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)",0.8559058308601379,0.8598082065582275,0.8520387411117554,0.3482587064676617,0.12060301507537688,0.08121827411167513,0.27860696517412936,0.27860696517412936
44,"Professor chemical mechanics is very important for studying the energy of molecules. Two cases are proposed: van der Waals radii, which is caused by pulling a bromine towards a neighbor; and Baeyer’s, which involves a “plum-pudding” atom that has enough kinetic energy to go over the molecular floor. Averaging of kinetic isotope reveals dissociation of a molecule with enough kinetic potential to go across the face. The wave function is introduced and students learn how to calculate kinetic order in such cases. In both cases kinetic isotopes can be discriminated by applying a variety of techniques including x-ray diffraction to determine kinetic order.Professor McBride‘s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Although molecular mechanics is imperfect, it is useful for discussing molecular structure and energy in terms of standard covalent bonds. Analysis of the Cambridge Structural Database shows that predicting bond distances to within 1% required detailed categorization of bond types. Early attempts to predict heats of combustion in terms of composition proved adequate for physiology, but not for chemistry. Group- or bond-additivity schemes are useful for understanding heats of formation, especially when corrected for strain. Heat of atomization is the natural target for bond energy schemes, but experimental measurement requires spectroscopic determination of the heat of atomization of elements in their standard states.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)",0.8459845781326294,0.8431093692779541,0.8488794565200806,0.28695652173913044,0.07017543859649122,0.04424778761061946,0.1826086956521739,0.1826086956521739
45,"The conjugation of a single bond is worth more in terms of the interaction of two orbitals across a normal double bond. The special properties that biological systems have when they are adjacent to one another are due to their stereochemistry, which is the reason why molecular rotation is so subtle. Artificial or natural “rotating” forces” are also used to explain net optical rotation. Averaging of molecular rotation reverses between allylic dissociation energies and van der Waals repulsion.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Despite the substantial change in the energy of individual orbitals, the overall pi-electron energy and orbital shape changes little upon linear conjugation of two double bonds. Conjugation energy of polyenes and allylic systems may be predicted by means of a semicircle mnemonic. The much greater stabilization in “aromatic” conjugated rings, and Hückel’s 4n+2 rule, derive from alternating stabilization and destabilization of successive orbitals when the ends of a conjugated chain overlap as it is closed to form a ring. A circle mnemonic predicts orbital energies for conjugated rings.

46,Professorreliminary X-ray analysis of molecules that are unusually stable by the year 2100 shows how molecular rotation can be used to convert conversion states to transition states. Diels-Alder also uses stereochemistry (steric hindrance and ring strain) to determine net stereochemical odds for a variety of chemical reactions. The competition between Baeyer’s and Farinata‘s double-step mechanism is shown to involve simultaneous electrophilic and electron-pair repulsion reactions. Cyclopene hydrolyzed by Grignard reagents and anhydrides intermediates compete with both natural and artificial nucleophiles to form a “plumant” compound.Professor McBride website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011),"Cyclic conjugation that arises when -orbitals touch one another can be as important for transition states as aromaticity is for stable molecules. It is the controlling factor in “pericyclic” reactions. Regiochemistry, stereochemistry, and kinetics show that two new sigma bonds are being formed simultaneously, if not symmetrically, in the 6-electron Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Although thermal dimerization of thymine residues in DNA is forbidden, photochemistry allows the 4-electron cycloaddition. “Electrocyclic” ring opening or closing chooses a conrotatory Möbius pathway, or a disrotatory Hückel pathway, according to the number of electron pairs involved and whether light is used in the process. Dewar benzene provides an example of a very unstable molecule that can be formed photochemically and then persists because of unfavorable orbital overlap in the transition state for ring opening.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",0.8414217233657837,0.8458257913589478,0.837063193321228,0.35390946502057613,0.0995850622406639,0.041841004184100423,0.18930041152263374,0.18930041152263374

The limited pK scale in water can be extended dramatically by titration in other solvents, providing one of the best ways to measure many “effects” in organic chemistry.

48,"Professor chemical shift, which involves the unverifiable field due to the tilt of the electron in the NMR molecule’s rotation axis, is used to investigate the magnetic field generated by a parcel of anisotropy. The “chemical shift” caused by a dropped egg that spatters on the floor can be visualized by means of a “plum-pudding” mechanism. A mechanism for identifying the presence of such a mechanism is described using acoustic depth profiling. The NMR spectroscopy method allows one to immediately identify the source of a wave. The hydrostatic law is introduced and students learn how to recognize and manufacture “rotating waves” that discriminate between groups of protons and molecules.Professor McBride website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Through-space interaction between magnets of fixed strength and orientation averages to zero during random molecular tumbling, suggesting that the local field about a proton should be sensitive only to electrons that orbit about itself. The chemical shift can be sensitive to electrons orbiting elsewhere if the amount of orbiting varies with molecular orientation. This “diamagnetic anisotropy” is commonly used to rationalize the unusual chemical shifts of protons in acetylene and in aromatic and antiaromatic compounds. The other source of a proton’s local field is nearby magnetic nuclei, which can be counted by the splitting multiplicity. Unlike chemical shift, which is measured in fractional units because it depends on the strength of the applied field, this spin-spin splitting (), measured in Hz, is dependent only on molecular structure. depends not on spatial proximity, but on orbital overlap, which, remarkably, is larger for anti- than for eclipsed conformations.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",0.8475084900856018,0.8552801609039307,0.8398767709732056,0.3884892086330935,0.10869565217391305,0.0364963503649635,0.20143884892086333,0.20143884892086333

50,The Friedel-Crafts model of triphenylmethyl derived by the Swedish apothecary in 1891 corresponds to the German conquest of Damascus. The Baeyer factor favors “single-family homes” because it is easier to do so than to make a multiple-family home. Designing the structure of these structures allows choosing whether one should choose between two or more paths to homologation. Many chemical reactions can be understood in terms of the mixing of various atoms in the passage of a molecule’s DNA.

Many results of chemical transformation involving reflection, refraction (mirrors and lenses) are based on the mixing of wave functions of similar ordered particles. The NMR spectroscopic method allows simultaneous mixing of different molecular orbitals in relative phase with time. The Doppler shift in the infrared spectra allows simultaneous formation of unusual “bits” of light.

Infrared spectra reveal atomic vibration frequencies, which are related by Hooke’s law to bond strengths and “reduced” masses.

The Baeyer-Villiger reaction creates three bonds that leave an H, E, and CH group unchanged through a single atom. Aromatic rings can be intermediates or transition states of acid derivatives, while terminal cyclopropanes can be oxidizers. Reduction of alcohols by elemental bromine and by Grignard reagents can be studied in analogous terms.

Although the migrating groups are formally anionic, relative migratory aptitudes show that they give up electron density during rearrangement. Acid dissociation of protons a to a carbonyl group to form enolates, and the ease of forming enols, gives α-carbons nucleophilic reactivity under both basic and acidic conditions.

Timgad was created as an entirely new colony for Roman army veterans by Trajan in A.D. 100, and designed all at once as an ideal plan. Leptis Magna, conversely, grew more gradually from its Carthaginian roots, experiencing significant Roman development under Augustus and Hadrian. Septimius Severus, the first Roman emperor from North Africa, was born at Leptis and his hometown was renovated in connection with his historic visit to the city. This large-scale program of architectural expansion features the Severan Forum and Basilica and the nearby Arch of Septimius Severus, a or four-sided arch located at the crossing of two major streets.

54,"Professor Kleiner discusses what she calls baroque architecture in the early part of the 19th century. Baroque elements were first introduced in the vocabulary of Greek and Etruscan architecture, especially the tower tombs at Palermo. The lecture features two of the most distinctive elements of Italian architecture: columns and entablature. City planning in this period is also discussed, as are examples of the first uses of the arch, a narrow opening that leads from one level to the next. The so-called trapezoidal brick construction of these structures is contrasted with the concrete-faced concrete construction of Quirinal Hill and Neaporta at Palmyra. All of these buildings conform to the requirements of the modern architectural genre of “red light” that they use to open up the possibility of a spiral frieze.","Professor Kleiner features the baroque phenomenon in Roman architecture, in which the traditional vocabulary of architecture, consisting of columns and other conventional architectural elements, is manipulated to enliven building façades and inject them with dynamic motion. This baroque trend is often conspicuously ornamental and began to be deployed on the walls of forums and tombs in Italy already in the late first century A.D. But baroque architecture in Roman antiquity was foremost in the Greek East where high-quality marble and expert marble carvers made it the architectural mode of choice. At Petra in Jordan, tomb chambers were cut into cliffs and elaborate façades carved out of the living rock. The cities of Miletus and Ephesus in Asia Minor were adorned with gates and fountains and libraries and stage buildings that consisted of multi-storied columnar screens. The lecture culminates with the Sanctuary of Jupiter Heliopolitanus, a massive temple complex at Baalbek in Lebanon, with Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus in enormous scale and with extreme embellishment, and the Temple of Venus with an undulating lintel that foreshadows the curvilinear flourishes of Francesco Borromini’s",0.8416609764099121,0.8494680523872375,0.8339961767196655,0.3824451410658307,0.06309148264984227,0.00634920634920635,0.20689655172413793,0.20689655172413793

80,"Professor course begins with a brief introduction to Fredric Jameson, the student at the University of Adelaide who introduced the modernist aesthetic of romances. He goes on to discuss several specific aesthetic modes, such as “traditional” and “signifyified.” The Realist aesthetic is defined through the use of diagrams and words. Jameson’s theory of interpretive ambiguity is applied to the work of painter Edvard Munch. His film criticism, focused on the relation between desire and need, is explored in connection with Lacan. Finally, the theory of autonomous art is addressed with reference to the works of major nineteenth-century painters, including Pound, Eliot, and Cubist painters.","In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores Fredric Jameson’s seminal work,, as an outcropping of Marxist literary criticism and structural theory. Texts such as Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind” and Shakespeare’s seventy-third sonnet are examined in the context of Jameson’s three horizons of underlying interpretive frameworks–the political, the social, and the historical, each carefully explained. The extent to which those frameworks permeate individual thought is addressed in a discussion of Jameson’s concept of the “ideologeme.” The theorist’s work is juxtaposed with the writings of Bakhtin and Levi-Strauss.

Derrida, a Yale scholar who argued that the ethical turn in thinking about literature and other matters is the crucial step in the development of modernism. The notion of “the ethical turn” that was associated with Levi-Strauss’s French studies of interpretive authority is explored in connection with his own work on interpretive interpretation. The relationship between reading and interpretation, particularly through the lens of Jakobson, is elucidated through the writings of Paul Boorse and Hans Robert Nemiroff. The lecture concludes with an analysis of some of the more visually-oriented aspects of interpreting literature in the twentieth century.","In this lecture on Derrida and the origins of deconstruction, Professor Paul Fry explores two central Derridian works: “Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of Human Sciences” and “Différance.” Derrida’s critique of structuralism and semiotics, particularly the work of Levi-Strauss and Saussure, is articulated. Deconstruction’s central assertions that language is by nature arbitrary and that meaning is indeterminate are examined.

83,"Themeneutics arose in the Middle Ages as a way of interpreting the Bible through the art and sciences of interpretation. The hermeneutic movement moved from its beginnings in the late Middle Ages through the Reformation, up to the rise of constitutional democracies in the 19th century. Its structure and methodical interpretation of the Bible is still very famous today. Although there are many definitions of the term “library” according to which the author’s personal reticence is the source of all the information we obtain through his reading. Reading the Bible out loud through the interpreters’ lenses helps us understand the world through our perceptions of the presence of the text.","In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines acts of reading and interpretation by way of the theory of hermeneutics. The origins of hermeneutic thought are traced through Western literature. The mechanics of hermeneutics, including the idea of a hermeneutic circle, are explored in detail with reference to the works of Hans-George Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, and E. D. Hirsch.

85,"Theonzález Echevarría continues his discussion of literature by answering several questions related to the Spanish interest in reading and interpretation. The first is a question of the originality of literature, which was written in 1605 and became popular in the 1600s. The second is an exploration of the cultural boundaries that define literature as a means of engaging with history. Cervantes’ book,, is a meditation on the process of representing the past through the eyes of readers. In the third part of the lecture he comments on the similarities and differences between literature and culture. He analyzes the relation between desire and need, language and intention, among other things, and sees how the two traits that common people enjoy in reading: they are oppositions that coexist in our collective imagination.

González Echevarría believes that the is about the effect that literature has on its readers and about the creation of literature. Its story does not belong to any previous tradition but it is a new story, and this act of invention by a fifty-year old man, Cervantes, is in itself part of modern literature. González Echevarría comments on why the creation of this work was possible in the Spain of the seventeenth century and, after making some important distinctions between the concepts novel and romance, chivalric romances and courtly romance, explains that the is the first novel because it portrays the clash between the protagonist and his setting for the first time.

103,"The this lecture, Professor Gendler introduces the concept of civil punishment. Three different theories are briefly sketched: deontological and desertion theories on the one hand, and consequentialist theories based on the work of Aristotle on the other. In the first unit of the course, punishment is applied to situations where the victim’s desire to avoid punishment is more profound than that of others. When it comes to moral luck, though, the consequences of punishment are bound to be astronomic. On the other hand, punishments are comparatively limited in their impact on the human behavior. To understand punishment differently, we must consider cases in which the victim was punished for his or her actions.","In the opening part of the lecture, Professor Gendler concludes her discussion of punishment by exploring how Alan Kazdin’s research on effective parenting provides insights about techniques for rehabilitating individuals who violate societal norms. She then moves to the third large unit of the course: the question of the legitimacy and structure of the state. One answer to the question of state legitimacy–that of Thomas Hobbes–is presented. Hobbes argues that life without a government, in a “state of nature,” would be “nasty, poor, solitary, brutish, and short” as a result of violent competition for resources. To avoid this situation, Hobbes contends that rational individuals should lay down some of their rights in order to receive the benefits of a centralized state, to the extent that others are also willing to do so.",0.849608838558197,0.8526768088340759,0.8465628027915955,0.36144578313253006,0.07287449392712551,0.024489795918367342,0.21686746987951808,0.21686746987951808

105,"Professor Gendler begins with a brief introduction to the first part of the course, focusing on the “knight’s move” – a hypothetical case in which two individuals were involved in a process of habituation by accident. Three cases are considered: the Trolley Bystander case, the Korean nuclear waste storage case, and the United States’ 2002 Civil Rights bill. The latter two cases involve large numbers of people, motivated neither by malice nor by ideology, but rather by the desire to avoid punishment. In both cases, the victim is identified and the burden of proof is derived.","Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of differing responses to hypothetical and actual examples, and offers an actual example of a Trolley Problem. Then, the central topic of the lecture, punishment, is presented. After offering a characterization of what civil punishment involves, Professor Gendler discusses various justifications that have been offered of the practice. She distinguishes between justifications that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking, and between justifications that are primarily victim-directed and those that are primarily offender-directed.

A concluding summary of the course is offered.","We become virtuous by acting as if we are virtuous. This central insight of Aristotle is explored in this lecture. Professor Gendler begins by explaining how Aristotle’s method can allow us to turn normative laws–which describe how we act–into descriptive laws–which describe how we act.

108,"Professor’s colonial territories were of very high importance after the embarrassment of occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon was forced into exile for a time, and many French settlers arrived in the colonies after the war. During this time, the U.S. had a culture of decentralized mercantilism far removed from the militarism and excess associated with the courts of Louis XIV and Frederick the Great. The growth of plural populations resulted in the growth of poverty and vagrancy. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the consequences of these two factors. On the one hand, population levels rose; on the other hand, they remained high; the dangers of population growth were present and the challenges of reentering society were solved.","Prior to Malthus, population growth was seen as good for the power and wealth of a country. The rapid population growth of America was crucial in expelling England (via the Revolution) and France (via the Louisiana Purchase) from the US. But in fact, the numbers of the poor were growing in Europe in the 1700s. Malthus argued that poverty was due to an imbalance between people and resources; since population could rise very fast, it could always outstrip any gains in productivity. He did not anticipate an exponential increase in production or a voluntary decrease in fertility. However, Malthus’ thinking is still important because high population levels and environmental limitations are in fact problematic today. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mortality was falling in Europe and this caused a population explosion. The productivity gains of the Industrial Revolution were nearly balanced by the increased population; per capita income of the working classes was not much improved. Fertility didn’t drop until late in the nineteenth century; per capita income started to grow rapidly. The reason for the fertility decline is not well explained by declining mortality or rising standard of living or any other socioeconomic factor. The mortality and later fertility drop is called the Demographic Transition.

109,"There prehistoric data on the level of hunter-gatherers in the Early Middle Ages shows that there was a great density of hunters, probably because they were able to hunt in shallow water. Later, we saw these same traits in humans as well as other species, such as primates and whales. These traits can be seen in measurements taken at the rate of change in the population. The physical environment also allows us to detect changes in the strength of the animal’s migration.","Hunter-gatherer populations were much less dense than later agriculturalists. The variety of their food supply protected them from crop failures and their sparseness reduced the spread of infectious diseases. Hunter-gatherers were healthier and worked less than early agriculturalists. Why didn’t their numbers increase up to the same level of Malthusian misery? Their numbers may have been limited by violence between groups. Agriculture is more work intense and offers a less varied diet. Populations seem to grow rapidly and then die out suddenly. Populations are subject to climatic- or disease-caused crop failure. But farming allows individuals to produce a surplus of food that can then be stolen by warrior tribes or military castes. The surplus allows for population growth, cities and stratified societies. The death rate, until perhaps the 1700s in Europe, is enormously high: only approximately a third of women survive to the end of their reproductive period. At this death rate, surviving women who are able to reproduce must have more than six children on average or the society goes extinct.

110,"Sexeding is not simple or easy, nor is it fair. Females can either engage in sperm competition with males or compete with the females to get resources from the male. Asexual reproduction is not common in these species. Females often engage in a physical competition among herself and other members of the same species. Often the fight between males and females is not won by the two strategies that the males use as an evolutionary tool: the mating strategy for males and the combinatorial strategy for females. Both strategies are supported by the environment and children.","Chimpanzee males compete for position in a dominance hierarchy; status often depends on support from other members, including females, of the group. High-ranking males have much greater sexual access to females in estrus. Males control females by physical violence and intimidation. Chimpanzees also engage in purposeful raids to kill members of other chimpanzee groups. This inter-group violence can help explain intra-group violence. To fend off attack from other groups, males must remain in groups and that requires males to compete for mating opportunities within the community. Competition for the scarce resource, eggs, leads to male-male violence and male coercion of females. If the alpha male monopolized all reproductive potential, then evolution would push non-dominant males to either fight continually for dominance or to leave the group and find females elsewhere.

Different ways of defining black as both a white person and an African American are discussed, including the former’s designation as a “nigger,” the latter of which is determined by a process of convergence among the different racial groups. The remainder of the lecture focuses on the unresolved problem of reconciling the dual identities of Joe Christmas and Nella Larsen.

In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the complicated meaning of the word “democracy” as it is applied to the expression of nationalist and right-wing sentiments. While the truth behind such popular upsurge is often obscured, so too is the nature of the movement. By the end of the 1960s, many people were prepared to enlarge their understanding of the world so that it became clear that people cared little for the larger political and social traumas of Vietnam.

The period before the partitions of the Treaty of Verdun which created the English empire in 1633, is also described, with the figure of William Butler Yeats as well as the logocentric approach to interpreting the Bible through his analysis of the journey of the Aengus between Scotland and Ireland. The latter approach was based upon an analysis of archaeological evidence taken from the “Crazy Jane” site at Jarrow, and later discovered at Bath by the archaeologist John Connery. The course ends with a brief overview of tomb architecture in England and traces the connections between religion and history.","In this lecture, Professor Freedman considers the importance of the British Isles in the early Middle Ages, both in their own right and as an example of a post-Roman frontier society. In the wake of the fifth century Roman withdrawal, England experienced “radical economic simplification.” However, England’s conversion to Christianity beginning at the end of the sixth century brought about a flourishing written culture and Latin learning. Ireland experienced a similar cultural flowering, although it had converted to Christianity centuries earlier. It had never been colonized by the Romans, and the Irish Church was less hierarchical, more decentralized, and placed less importance on bishops than did the Roman. The conversion of England under the competeing influences of Rome and ireland was thus not just a conflict between Christianity and paganism, but also between two administrative styles of Christianity.

In the second half of the lecture, he discusses the decline of the Soviet Union which had once held it together while the latter was dismantled by the Persian invaders. After this decline, the Russian czars were able to regain some lost territory through an impressive display of military technology. However, the archival evidence suggests that the Russian Empire was unable to hold on to these previously lost territories and so contracted for over a century of crisis that threatened its survival. During this interval, the fate of the early Russian settlers in the West was bound up in the struggle for power amongst competing political factions in Russia.","Peter the Great’s historical significance stems not only from his military ambitions and the great expansion of the Russian Empire under his supervision, but also from his efforts to introduce secular, Western customs and ideas into Russian culture.

Alongside such luminaries as those associated with Diderot’s were a host of lesser pamphleteers and libellists eager for fame and some degree of fortune. If the writings of this latter group were typically vulgar and bereft of literary merit, they nonetheless contributed to the “desacralization” of monarchy in the eyes of the growing literate public.

However, these technological and scientific advances in the field of epidemiology resulted in only a few specific problems. One of the most pervasiveness of malaria was the loss of an innate and adaptive immune response (SAA) to malaria. In both countries, SAA was able to effectively combat the disease by providing antiseptics and other treatments.

He describes the three strategies that have been used to combat malaria: sanitary conditions, infanticide, and the introduction of vaccines.","In the last decade of the nineteenth century, malariology emerged as the most prestigious and intellectually exciting field in the new discipline of tropical medicine.

132,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses the issues behind the reformation of the early modern English church. On the one hand, the success of the reform was uneven across the country; on the other hand, there were many changes in religious culture which had little impact on traditionalists and Puritans. One of the most significant questions raised by the Reformation was whether or not the new trends represented in the arch celebrated the true significance of the period. In the second half of the lecture he turns to the so-called Commonwealth’s Menaces, a narrow forum begun in the late sixteenth century by the English apothecary George Grenville. The debate over the role of the church in early modern England is then explored with an emphasis placed on the benefits that the latter had for the well-educated.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson surveys the religious landscape of England during the later medieval period through to the reign of Henry VIII and the beginnings of the reformation. He notes that while the late medieval church was more vibrant and popular than many early triumphal analysis of the reformation allowed for, there were, nonetheless, critics of Catholicism within England. He traces the earlier opposition to the church as arising from three primary groups: those educated clerics and laymen who desired reform within the church, the small pockets of Lollards within England who opposed traditional religion, and the group of people influenced by European reformation thought who would later work to implement doctrinal change within the Church of England. Professor Wrightson also provides an analysis of late medieval piety and the role that the traditional church played in people’s daily lives at the local level prior to the reformation.",0.8648777008056641,0.863527774810791,0.8662317395210266,0.38062283737024216,0.0975609756097561,0.02105263157894737,0.2422145328719723,0.2422145328719723
133,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses the major events of the English Civil Wars which culminated ultimately with the execution of King Charles I in 1649. The success of these Puritan efforts at local reformation and the establishment of independent magistrates’ commissions (the so-called Cavalier Parliament) resulted in the rise of nationalist sentiment across the country. In the remainder of the lecture, he discusses the various forms of political engagement which occurred during the period leading up to the war, culminating in the victory of the Suffolk Constituent Conference in 1642. Professor Wrightse identifies three significant trends in early modern political life: urban expansion, the growth of traditional institutions such as the guilds and the introduction of new ones such as those created in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He ends by discussing the manner in which these trends played a role in the growing tensions over royal policy.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson discusses the Restoration settlement of 1660 and the reigns of Charles II and James II. He highlights the manner in which tensions between the crown and the political nation slowly escalated during Charles’s reign (as a result of his attempts to grant religious toleration, unpopular wars against the Dutch and diplomatic alliances with France). Charles showed himself to be a shrewd politician and managed to contain these tensions, but the situation became increasingly fraught after the alleged “Popish Plot” precipitated the Exclusion Crisis of 1679-81 and the emergence of the Whig and Tory parties. Charles faced down the threat to his authority successfully. However, he was succeeded in 1685 by his openly Catholic brother James II, who proved politically inept and unable to build on Charles’ success. Fears of James’ catholicizing and absolutist intentions erupted in 1688 in the Glorious Revolution, when the Dutch leader William of Orange (husband of James’ daughter Mary) was invited to intervene, leading in James’ flight abroad and the offer of the crown to William and Mary.",0.8516950011253357,0.8578165769577026,0.8456602692604065,0.3504531722054381,0.07902735562310029,0.03669724770642202,0.21148036253776437,0.21148036253776437
134,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson explores the various ways in which violence was dealt with in both the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He begins by describing the “moss-troopers” who were involved in large numbers of petty crimes. The second half of the lecture focuses on the manner in which these crimes were perpetrated by individuals rather than groups. Both types of crimes were first seen in the exceptionally large number of trials conducted in the county of Essex in the late eighteenth and early tenures. In the remainder of the lectures, he focuses on two specific cases (the Pilgrimage of Grace and the Act of Uniformity), both of which were carried out by the English Crown in the 1620s. While both cases involve large scale concealment, the actual crime taking place in these cases is unclear. Professor Wrightse identifies the rise in state terrorism across the country.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson examines the problem of order in early modern society, focusing on crimes of violence and upon property crime. In examining violence, he notes the existence of special cases geographically (the borderlands) and socially (aristocratic violence) before looking at the lower (and gradually declining) levels of homicide in general. He then considers property crime, distinguishing the various categories of theft and the manner in which cases were brought to, and handled in, the courts. The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries witnessed a peak in prosecution, but while the law could be harsh and bloody in meting out punishment, it was also characterized by discretionary extension of mercy. Interpretations of the use of such discretion are compared and assessed – as are the limits that existed on its use in a society that believed in the deterrent effect of “exemplary punishment.”",0.8594323992729187,0.8628307580947876,0.856060802936554,0.4285714285714286,0.12328767123287673,0.06206896551724138,0.24489795918367346,0.24489795918367346
135,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson traces the development of urban centers in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The growth of these centers was primarily due to the increasing industrialization and population growth in urban areas. City planning also added to the pressures faced by many urban center dwellers. As a result, urban centers were able to expand even more rapidly than they would have otherwise. In the second half of the seventeenth century, an increase in industrial output resulted in a rise in poverty and vagrancy. Despite occasional crises of mortality, most urban centers still remained on the high social status of blacks, whites, and Puritans. Faced with the unprecedented financial crisis of the 1670s and the Great Depression of the 1780s, these trends accelerated under the government of Sir Thomas Smith. Although economic patterns appear similar to today, they are not identical.","Professor Wrightson discusses the remarkable growth of the British economy in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He examines the changed context of stable population and prices; regional agricultural specialization; urbanization; the expansion of overseas trade both with traditional European trading partners and with the Americas and the East; the growth of manufacturing industries which served both domestic and overseas markets, and the intensification of internal trade. He describes and explains the emergence of an increasingly closely articulated national market economy, closely linked to a nascent world economy in which Britain now played a core role.",0.8551468849182129,0.852977991104126,0.8573267459869385,0.3305785123966942,0.10833333333333334,0.058823529411764705,0.2396694214876033,0.2396694214876033
136,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses the developments of the English civil wars. He notes that while the early part of the 1645s were dominated by nationalist and right-wing factions (notably the New Model Army), these trends accelerated after Charles’s victory in the Battle of Poitiers in 1646. In 1645, both sides concerned by the local activism of Puritans and Puritans were able to secure a shared cause through their dissatisfaction with the new measures imposed by the new Model Army. Despite their struggle for control over Puritan policy, these two groups remained committed to staying the course. In the second half of the lecture, he discusses the Arminian movement (anti-Calvinist in doctrine and with strong elements of ritualism and clericalism.","In this lecture Professor Wrightson considers the events leading to the execution of Charles I in 1649, and the republican regimes of 1649-60 (the Commonwealth and the Protectorate), with particular attention to the role of Oliver Cromwell. He begins with the unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement with Charles I after the civil war, the intervention of the army in 1647 and the outbreak of the second civil war in 1648, which culminated in Pride’s Purge and the trial and execution of Chares I. He then considers Cromwell’s campaigns in 1649-51, his expulsion of the Rump Parliament in 1653, the nominated parliament of 1653 (Barebone’s Parliament) and the two phases of the Cromwellian Protectorate 1654-8, ending with the instability following Cromwell’s death and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Professor Wrightson notes that although the Restoration marked the failure of the revolution, the political landscape had been irrevocably changed. The restored monarchy lived in the shadow of the civil war, the politicization of a large section of society was not reversed, religious dissent was now a permanent reality, and a plethora of new political and",0.8440214991569519,0.8462948203086853,0.8417604565620422,0.3217665615141956,0.06984126984126984,0.012779552715654953,0.22082018927444794,0.22082018927444794
137,"Professor this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses the social order in the early sixteenth century. Different social groups were formed by the common people from various backgrounds, such as the “chivalry” of the English church, the ‘collective conscience,’ and the so-called Commonwealth’s Men. The eclectic mix of these social groups was united under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell and William Butler, whose economic interpretations of the commonwealth were explored with particular attention paid to their effects on the poor.

The differences between the social structure in rural and urban areas are addressed and the subordinate roles of women and the young are also outlined. Professor Wrightson discusses the differences between members of peerage, the gentry, and the commonalty and the social positions of servants, yeoman, husbandmen, and apprentices are explained. The mechanisms by which the social order was preserved, such as prescriptive literature and ecclesiastical injunctions, are also considered. Professor Wrightson concludes that, while in the theory the social order was rigidly hierarchical and rooted in relationships of authority and subordination, in practice there was a great more flexibility and ambiguity within every day interpersonal social relationships.",0.8571320176124573,0.8614308834075928,0.852875828742981,0.3893129770992366,0.0923076923076923,0.031007751937984492,0.22137404580152673,0.22137404580152673

The distinctive nature of these accounts and the manner in which they were circulated around the colonies is also considered. Professor Freeman ends with a discussion of the importance of the “honor principle” to British colonists.","Professor Freeman continues her discussion of the Boston Massacre and how it represented a growing sense of alienation between the American colonists and the British authorities. The Americans and British both felt that the colonies were subordinate to Parliament in some way, but differed in their ideas of the exact nature of the imperial relationship.

139,"Professor this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the logic behind British military strategies during the American Revolution. First, she discusses the logistic disadvantages that the British faced in organizing their defensive campaign: difficulties in recruiting British soldiers to fight in America; and difficulties in organizing a war effort when the British assumed that isolating the British from the rest of the colonies would prove to be an inevitable event. In addition, the British consistently underestimated the revolutionaries in America, and overestimated Loyalist support. During this time, the faltering of morale among the colonists resulted in the rise of mutinies across the colonies. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture by describing the decision to go to war.","Today’s lecture concludes Professor Freeman’s discussion of the four phases of the Revolutionary War. America’s victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 marked the end of the third phase of the war, and led to a turning point in the conflict: France’s decision to recognize American independence and enter into an alliance with the fledging nation. Although the British made one final attempt at reconciliation in 1778 with the Conciliatory Propositions, they were rejected by the Continental Congress. The fourth and final phase of the war lasted from 1779 to 1781, as the British Army focused its attention on the American South. The British seized Charleston and South Carolina, and defeated the Continental Army in a series of battles. But with the help of the French fleet, Washington was able to defeat Cornwallis’s army at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.

Although they represented an attempt on the part of Americans to form independent governments, many Americans saw them as a way to improve conditions for their political liberties. In October 1779, the Continental Congress passed both the radical Suffolk Resolves and the Declaration and Resolves, which laid out the colonists’ grievances with Great Britain. Throughout the colonies, local communities began debating whether or not they could be effective in governing the nation at large scale. These local declarations of independence contributed to the formal formation of three new national governments that came into existence after the British withdrawal from the colonies. Some feared that these new “states” would lead to the collapse of the American experiment in government.","This lecture discusses the ongoing political experimentation involved in creating new constitutions for the new American states. Having declared independence from Great Britain, Americans had to determine what kind of government best suited their individual states as well as the nation at large; to many, this was the “whole object” of their revolutionary turmoil.

The nature of the slave society and the manner in which it was defended from both whites and African Americans were forced into exile for a time. After Charles Sumner presided over the drafting of the new Constitution in 1845, the Panic of 1846 resulted in the impeachment of one president (Andrew Johnson) and the birth of the Republican party (Ulysses S. Grant).

The most lasting and influential sources of Civil War memory are Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. An examination of some of the best-known funerary scenes in the U.S. military, including Confederate General Robert E.

The latter section is shown to exemplify the modern concept of right-wing political thinking, with elements of African-American literature and history that made the early part of the nineteenth century possible.","In this lecture, Professor Blight discusses some of the conflicts, controversies, and compromises that led up to the Civil War.

He discusses the internal slave trade that moved thousands of slaves from the eastern seaboard to the cotton states of the Southwest between 1820 and 1860. Professor Blight then sketches the contents of the pro-slavery argument, including its biblical, historical, economic, cynical, and utopian aspects.",0.8463802933692932,0.83982914686203,0.853034496307373,0.3270440251572327,0.05095541401273885,0.0,0.20125786163522014,0.20125786163522014
152,"Professor Blight begins this lecture with a discussion of the nature of southern society. After discussing slavery in the nineteenth century, Blight focuses on the ideas of “proto-slavery” and “the resurgence of slaveholding.“The nature of Northern society is very vivid today.” The lecture concludes with an analysis of some of the forces that motivated Americans to go to war.","Having finished with slavery and the pro-slavery argument, Professor Blight heads North today. The majority of the lecture deals with the rise of the Market Revolution in the North, in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. Blight first describes the causes of the Market Revolution–the rise of capital, a transportation revolution–and then moves to its effects on the culture and consciousness of antebellum northerners. Among these effects were a riotous optimism mixed with a deep-rooted fear of change, an embrace of the notions of progress and Manifest Destiny, and the intensification of the divides between North and South.",0.8624435663223267,0.8736701607704163,0.8515017032623291,0.3703703703703704,0.125,0.012658227848101267,0.25925925925925924,0.25925925925925924
153,"The put option, a put option that is the right to buy and sell a share at a specified price. A call option, which is the put option on an individual level, is the best option for both American options and European options. A put option can be used to convert a call option to an option. An option to buy a share of stock in a specified way is the option to immediately take such a step. In the beginning of the lecture, Professor Shiller emphasizes two purposes of options trading: putting option prices on single-family homes in New York City, and writing them when values are higher. Subsequently, he presents the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula for single- family homes in Chicago, which leads to the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s online tool for tracking insider information. The actual S&P 500 Home Price Index is published every day in January 2011.","Options introduce an essential nonlineary into portfolio management. They are contracts between buyers and writers, who agree on exercise prices and dates at which the buyer can buy or sell the underlying (such as a stock). Options are priced based on the price and volatility of the underlying asset as well as the duration of the option contract. The Black-Scholes options pricing model is one of the most famous equations in finance and offers a useful first approximation for prices for option contracts. Options exchanges and futures exchanges both are involved in creating a liquid and transparent market for options.

154,"Professor representative of Yale’s endowment, Professor David Swensen describes the organization of the Yale endowment. He discusses a few errors that were well-known and that are often exploited by unscrupulous people. In the second half of the lecture, he looks at Yale student errors in the law that are most prominent in the field of psychology. A number of problems are worked out in this case, including the difficulties that students face when attempting to identify and understanding these issues. The lecture concludes with a discussion of behavioral finance in the context of financial crises.","Regulation of financial and securities markets is intended to protect investors while still enabling them to make personal investment decisions. Psychological phenomena, such as magical thinking, overconfidence, and representativeness heuristic can cause deviations from rational behavior and distort financial decision-making. However, regulation and regulatory bodies, such as the SEC, FDIC, and SIPC, most of which were created just after the Great Depression, are intended to help prevent the manipulation of investors’ psychological foibles and maintain trust in the markets so that a broad spectrum of investors will continue to participate.",0.8315584063529968,0.8355945944786072,0.8275611400604248,0.22340425531914893,0.021505376344086023,0.0,0.14893617021276598,0.14893617021276598
155,"In Summers, former U. S. Treasury Secretary and former President of Harvard, in this the first of two lectures in honor of former Yale Professor Arthur Okun, Summers argues that a disinflation recession is best understood in terms of output decline and the level of output held in check by the economy. Recent economic cycles appear to be connected with factors endogenous to the financial system such as bubbles and short term interest rates. Summers also highlights the importance of thinking systematically about how the Fed balances the resources of the federal government during crises times, and addresses the recent “volunteers” crisis that appears to have occurred in the aftermath of the financial crisis from 2007-2008. In the second half of the lecture, Summers offers an alternative economic model for the U.S. financial system, one that captures the core financial patterns of the early 2000s. While the latter model does not capture the core psychological patterns of financial breakdowns, it does not fail to capture the fundamental financial breakdown caused by the 2008 financial crisis.","In the second of his two lectures in honor of Arthur Okun, Professor Summers points out that real interest rates have been very low in the current subprime crisis. This indicates that the shock to the economy was more a financial breakdown shock than a disinflation shock. But financial breakdown shocks are not necessarily very harmful to the economy, so long as financial intermediation capital is not destroyed. In a financial crisis like the present one, financial firms are likely to take the step of decreasing their leverage, often by contracting loans, which creates its own risks for the economy. Regulators should place pressure on financial institutions to raise their capital and should intervene in near foreclosure situations, but should not attempt to support housing prices.",0.8612115979194641,0.8553175330162048,0.8671875,0.36303630363036304,0.10631229235880399,0.026755852842809368,0.20462046204620463,0.20462046204620463

Subsequently, he presents the Yale model of asset allocation, focusing his attention on how allocations are distributed among individual investors and institutional investors. The main goals of the model are to maximize the Sharpe ratio of single-family homes to multiple equities. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Shiller offers some thoughts about diversification in stocks and other assets. He identifies three tools that can be used to manage diversification: endowment funds, pension funds, and credit unions. Lastly, he discusses the notion of “time-to-maturity”, defined as a means of diversification.","David Swensen, Yale’s Chief Investment Officer and manager of the University’s endowment, discusses the tactics and tools that Yale and other endowments use to create long-term, positive investment returns.

157,"Professor, Stephen Schwarzman, a prominent activist investor in corporate America, discusses his thoughts about today’s economy and American businesses. He sees opportunities for current, intelligent college students to succeed in the corporate world if they work hard and can identify valuable business pursuits. However, he also sees potential problems with weak management at the senior level and weak leadership at the junior level. In the beginning of the lecture, he addresses some of these issues by briefly discussing his views on the role of women in the modern workforce. In addition, he covers two types of companies, online dating services, and real estate financing. He identifies five forms of social security that are important for women: dating, paying taxes, auditing taxpayers, and defining acceptable channels through which individuals can identify their sources of income.","The stock market is the information center for the corporate sector. It represents individuals’ ownership in publicly-held corporations. Although corporations have a variety of stakeholders, the shareholders of a for-profit corporation are central since the company is ultimately responsible to them. Companies offer dividends, stock repurchases and stock dividends to give profits back to shareholders or to signal information. Companies can also take on debt to raise capital, creating leverage.

Using these techniques, we can construct a diversified portfolio that maximizes expected returns for a given level of risk. The U.S. has a history of outperforming other financial institutions in three different ways: it is the national government that leads the way to higher economic and financial goals; it is not the end of apartheid in Africa; and we are not the first nation to openly participate in the so-called Commonwealth’s Plan. In the second half of the lecture we introduce a key concept from the previous lecture: the risk management tool of psychological research.

We first distinguish two strategies in each subgame: an up-nighter strategy and a down-nighters strategy. Then we discuss strategies in such games that we can find Nash equilibrium in all of them. In the first part of the lecture we introduce a new idea: Nash equilibrium. Then our main strategies are introduced and we learn how to interpret them as information sets. A key idea here is that not all Nash equilibria of such games are equally plausible: some are inconsistent with backward induction; some involve non-Nash behavior in some (unreached) subgames.","We analyze three games using our new solution concept, subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE). The first game involves players’ trusting that others will not make mistakes. It has three Nash equilibria but only one is consistent with backward induction. We show the other two Nash equilibria are not subgame perfect: each fails to induce Nash in a subgame. The second game involves a matchmaker sending a couple on a date. There are three Nash equilibria in the dating subgame. We construct three corresponding subgame perfect equilibria of the whole game by rolling back each of the equilibrium payoffs from the subgame. Finally, we analyze a game in which a firm has to decide whether to invest in a machine that will reduce its costs of production.

The Swensen Approach resulted in the first swap transaction between an array of financial technologies, including the Dojima Curves and the Yale Board of Advisors. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Shiller discusses the motivations behind the swap transaction, including their ambition to create a national market for stocks and bonds. For the remainder of this lecture, he addresses the core elements of the modern concept of swap. At the beginning of the decade, the firm was unable to work with the market so rapidly that it became the dominant financial technology of the U.S. after the financial crisis of 2007-09.

Subsequently, Professor Swensen characterizes three major determinants of investment return–asset allocation, market timing, and security selection–and outlines the importance of asset allocation as the predominant component. Against the background of these three tenets, he revisits criticism and defends the virtues of diversification against an exaggerated perception of the needs for safety in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. Moreover, he counters the critique of overemphasizing alternatives with a longer-term view on the performance of the Yale portfolio.

168,"Professor mortgage is the most recent form of mortgage finance. It first appeared in Latin as a means to finance agricultural and industrial advances. The modern agent based approach to modeling rationalizes behavior among real estate buyers, and emphasizes the impact of agent based models on those principles. As a result, mortgages can be simplified into two primary types of mortgages: farmer’s land and pastoral homes. Commercial real estate seeks to maximize the value of a mortgage by taking on long-term debt. The second type of mortgage involves prepayments, which are endowments that help the seller to put money in the next phase of the mortgage process. Typically, collateral requirements for prepayment are tied with agent based prepayors. The most recent agent based model reveals that the most popular agent based method for modeling real estate is the “endowment option,” that is, endowment or endowment.","Real estate finance has been crucially important throughout its very long and complex history. Describing the history of mortgage financing, Professor Shiller highlights the historical development of well-institutionalized property rights for mortgage contracts. Subsequently, he focuses on modern financial institutions for commercial real estate, elaborating on Direct Participation Programs and Real Estate Investment Trusts as means for its financing. The distinction between short-term, balloon-payment mortgages before the Great Depression and long-term, amortizing mortgages thereafter shapes the discussion of residential real estate. His discussion of mortgage securitization and government support of mortgage markets centers around Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from their inception in 1938 and 1970, respectively, to the U.S. government’s decision to put them into federal conservatorship in 2008.

169,"The exchanges and clearinghouses, which were first created in primitive societies hundreds of years ago, have evolved into central economic concepts for the allocation of scarce resources to the productive power of the economy. Although they were originally designed to address the issues of speculation and price inflation, they have expanded into a more important economic concept. In the United States, the Chicago Board of Trade has been the most popular futures trading institution. The Chicago Board Options Exchange is the largest in the history of the S&P 500 index. It was founded in New York City in 1919 by Cornelius Vander Starr, a Korean shopkeeper who discovered the value of his goods at a point in time that he could not afford to ignore the other futures markets. Factors such as bubbles or cycles of complacency among individual investors are also discussed.","As the starting point for this lecture, Professor Shiller contrasts the view of economics as the theory of the allocation of scarce resources with the view of economics as the study of exchange. After a discussion of the difference between brokers and dealers, he outlines the history of securities exchanges from ancient Rome, to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Jonathan’s Coffee House in London, until the formation of the New York Stock Exchange. He complements this historic account with an overview of securities exchanges all over the world, covering India, China, Brazil, and Mexico. An example of a limit order book allows him to elaborate on the mechanics of trading at the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (NASDAQ). Subsequently, he turns his attention to the growing importance of program trading and high frequency trading, but also discusses their impact on the stock market crash from October 19, 1987, as well as on the Flash Crash from May 6, 2010. When talking about fairness in financial markets, particularly with regard to the relation between private investors and brokers, he discusses the National Market System (NMS), the Intermarket Trading System (ITS), and consolidated quotation systems.

Behavioral Finance emphasizes two traits among the basic elements of human behavior: personality and morality. In order to understand human errors, we must consider them in different dimensions. For instance, taking into account the biases that greatly influence human behavior, such as the tendency to look bad at others’ failures, we examine how these biases can be applied to financial institutions.","Deviating from an absolute belief in the principle of rationality, Professor Shiller elaborates on human failings and foibles. Acknowledging impulses to exploit these weaknesses, he emphasizes the role of factors that keep these impulses in check, specifically the desire for praise-worthiness from Adam Smith’s. After a discourse on Personality Psychology, Professor Shiller starts a list of important topics in Behavioral Finance with Daniel Kahneman’s and Amos Tversky’s Prospect Theory. The value function and the probability weighting function, as two key components of this theory, help explain certain patterns in people’s everyday decision making, e.g. the existence of diamond ring insurance and airline flight insurance. An in-class experiment underscores the prevalence and importance of the concept of overconfidence. Further topics include Regret Theory, gambling behavior, cognitive dissonance, anchoring, the representativeness heuristic, and social contagion.

171,"Professor lecture introduces the core concepts of risk and return. The Netherlands’ first open market market, founded in 1602, was one of the first for publicly-traded companies to use the term “consumer goods” to describe their initial financial goals. The second half of the lecture introduces students to the major elements of financial markets. From the perspective of innovation in the early years of the 19th century, Vereenigde Oost-Indische (VOC) became the biggest issuer of consumer goods, both using the same techniques as the modern concept of duality. The innovations made by the Dutch during this era are still discussed today.","In this lecture, Professor Shiller introduces mean-variance portfolio analysis, as originally outlined by Harry Markowitz, and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that has been the cornerstone of modern financial theory. Professor Shiller commences with the history of the first publicly traded company, the United East India Company, founded in 1602. Incorporating also the more recent history of stock markets all over the world, he elaborates on the puzzling size of the equity premium and the very high historical return of stock market investments. After introducing the notion of an Efficient Portfolio Frontier, he covers the concept of the Tangency Portfolio, which leads him to the Mutual Fund Theorem. Finally, the consideration of equilibrium in the stock market leads him to the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which emphasizes market risk as the determinant of a stock’s return.",0.8489736318588257,0.853577196598053,0.8444194197654724,0.4049586776859504,0.10833333333333332,0.025210084033613446,0.23966942148760328,0.23966942148760328
172,"The the first half of the lecture turns to the analysis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The key concepts in this model are the expected return and riskless payoff. We discuss Shakespeare’s risky strategy in depth, and see how it allows us to calculate an expected return for a dollar less a dollar. Lastly, we finish by laying some of the philosophical and statistical groundwork for thinking seriously about the role of risk in financial systems.","Until now we have ignored risk aversion. The Bernoulli brothers were the first to suggest a tractable way of representing risk aversion. They pointed out that an explanation of the St. Petersburg paradox might be that people care about expected utility instead of expected income, where utility is some concave function, such as the logarithm. One of the most famous and important models in financial economics is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which can be derived from the hypothesis that every agent has a (different) quadratic utility. Much of the modern mutual fund industry is based on the implications of this model. The model describes what happens to prices and asset holdings in general equilibrium when the underlying risks can’t be hedged in the aggregate. It turns out that the tools we developed in the beginning of this course provide an answer to this question.",0.8445659875869751,0.8531349897384644,0.8361674547195435,0.3571428571428571,0.0990990990990991,0.027272727272727275,0.1964285714285714,0.1964285714285714

The first option to get us beyond callingable bonds is the balloon payment option, which can be used to calculate the interest rate and the remaining balance. Taking account of the different types of mortgages that are calledable and non-callable, we can find the most popular option for mortgage prepayments. A second option on the market is the option to put a coupon bond at the end and use it to compute the change in the interest rates. We evaluate both options using the same duality method as well as the different methods used to compute them. The third option is the Option Pricing option which lets us find the best option for usurious buyers. We show how the option sets the stage for us to find an ideal mortgage.","This lecture is about optimal exercise strategies for callable bonds, which are bonds bundled with an option that allows the borrower to pay back the loan early, if she chooses. Using backward induction, we calculate the borrower’s optimal strategy and the value of the option. As with the simple examples in the previous lecture, the option value turns out to be very large. The most important callable bond is the fixed rate amortizing mortgage; calling a mortgage means prepaying your remaining balance. We examine how high bankers must set the mortgage rate in order to compensate for the prepayment option they give homeowners.

The financial equilibrium problem is presented in two separate ways: on the one hand, it is impossible to “beat the market.” On the other hand, the financial equilibrium problems are presented as an alternative to the general equilibrium problem, and various strategies can be employed to solve both problems. At the end of the lecture, he offers a glimpse into the future of Yale University.","In the 1990s, Yale discovered that it was faced with a deferred maintenance problem: the university hadn’t properly planned for important renovations in many buildings. A large, one-time expenditure would be needed. How should Yale have covered these expenses? This lecture begins by applying the lessons learned so far to show why Yale’s initial forecast budget cuts were overly pessimistic. In the second half of the class, we turn to the problem of measuring investment performance, and examine the strengths and weaknesses of various measures of yield, including yield-to-maturity and current yield.",0.8547925353050232,0.8596073389053345,0.850031316280365,0.3297872340425532,0.043010752688172046,0.010869565217391304,0.1702127659574468,0.1702127659574468

A mathematical formula for this is derived using the same techniques we used to compute the Dodgers’ victory over the Dodgers.","This lecture reviews the intuition from the previous class, where the idea of dynamic hedging was introduced. We learn why the crucial idea of dynamic hedging is marking to market: even when there are millions of possible scenarios that could come to pass over time, by hedging a little bit each step of the way, the number of possibilities becomes much more manageable.

Gravity acts on these density differences to cause large-scale thermohaline currents Wind driven ocean currents are forced by the wind stress acting on the ocean surface which indirectly causes geostrophic currents.",0.8184821009635925,0.8123706579208374,0.8246861696243286,0.23602484472049687,0.012578616352201259,0.0,0.1863354037267081,0.1863354037267081
192,The is the first of two types of analysis in the atmosphere. The dry adiabatic lapse rate and the temperature gradient are introduced. The second type of analysis is based on the concepts of “humors” and “dispersence.” Both types of modeling can be understood in terms of the mixing of gases and wind. A confined volume with a nonzero wind is used to model the change in the atmospheric temperature with changes in the wind. The greenhouse effect in rising air is also discussed.,"The lapse rate describes the rate at which air cools with altitude. Atmospheric stability depends on the lapse rate. When an air parcel is lifted or lowered, it can continue to rise or descend based on the temperature of the surrounding air at the new altitude, which indicates an unstable atmosphere. Inversions can occur in the atmosphere, meaning the air near the ground will be cooler than air aloft. This type of temperature profile can cause air to be trapped near the Earth’s surface in a boundary layer, which can also lead to pollutants being trapped near the ground.",0.8459079265594482,0.8398140072822571,0.8520908951759338,0.358695652173913,0.08791208791208792,0.02222222222222222,0.21739130434782608,0.21739130434782608
193,"The is the first of a series of lectures on the atmosphere. The topics discussed include the vertical structure of density, the pressure gradient in the atmosphere, and the relationship between temperature and pressure. The second half of the lecture focuses on the ideas of “negative gas” and “positive momentum.” The concepts of buoyancy and pressure are introduced and students learn how to calculate them quickly using the same techniques over time.","Pressure and density decrease exponentially with altitude in the atmosphere. This leads to buoyancy effects in the atmosphere when parcels of air are heated or cooled, or raised or lowered in the atmosphere. Temperature varies in a more complicated way with altitude in the atmosphere, with several inversions which occur at the boundaries of the various layers of the atmosphere. Solar radiation interacts differently with the gases that compose each layer of the atmosphere which affects which wavelengths of radiation are able to reach the surface of the Earth.",0.8507960438728333,0.8498669862747192,0.8517272472381592,0.3478260869565217,0.05031446540880504,0.012738853503184716,0.23602484472049687,0.23602484472049687
194,"The atmosphere is composed of gases that are emitted from the top of the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases are transferred poleward by the wind in the direction of the Coriolis force and are transported poleward through the passage of a narrow opening between the northern and southern hemispheres. The majority of large-scale motion in the atmosphere is in geostrophic balance, meaning the change in sign of an increase in pressure with depth in the air. A combination of this tilt produces shifts in the motion of parcels of gas in the upper reaches the atmosphere.","There are other ways in which we can perceive the existence of the atmosphere, predominantly through our perceptions of pressure. Not all planets have atmospheres, and the existence of an atmosphere depends on the ability of gas molecules to remain trapped close to a planet by its gravitational force. The molecular velocity of each gas molecule depends upon its molecular weight, and must exceed the escape velocity of the planet to leave the atmosphere.",0.8453373312950134,0.8327744007110596,0.8582850694656372,0.3391812865497076,0.07100591715976332,0.0,0.23391812865497075,0.23391812865497075

Political theories are also explored in the course. A historical critical study of political theories is undertaken in order to provide an antecedents for political developments. At the end of the lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores some of the major themes raised in political studies, such as the ideas of Aristotelian and Hobbes, Kantians, and others. The course ends with a question-and-answer session during which students inquire about two of the most salient questions in political philosophy: what does political philosophy mean for the well-being of people?","Professor Smith discusses the nature and scope of “political philosophy.” The oldest of the social sciences, the study of political philosophy must begin with the works of Plato and Aristotle, and examine in depth the fundamental concepts and categories of the study of politics.

The lecture concludes with the concept of the sovereign as the highest level of authority in the world.Thomas Hobbes, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","This is an introduction to the political views of Thomas Hobbes, which are often deemed paradoxical. On the one hand, Hobbes is a stern defender of political absolutism. The Hobbesian doctrine of sovereignty dictates complete monopoly of power within a given territory and over all institutions of civilian or ecclesiastical authority. On the other hand, Hobbes insists on the fundamental equality of human beings. He maintains that the state is a contract between individuals, that the sovereign owes his authority to the will of those he governs and is obliged to protect the interests of the governed by assuring civil peace and security.

198,"Professor Smith discusses the development of large-scale markets in the first half of the nineteenth century, growing pains, and increasing importance of railroads. The problems facing these markets were twofold: urban expansion, the decline of rural laborers, and the difficulties faced in finding an adequate transportation system for such a large volume of labor. Although it has survived so long, the joint stock corporation has been unable to hold on to market share for a million years.","Professor Rae explains how the growing scale and complexity of railroads in the US were foundational to the development of modern capitalism. Operating the railroad system required professional managers and new management techniques, and the scale of railroad financing gave rise to the formation of the joint stock corporation. Professor Rae then discusses how different forms of company ownership differ along liability, liquidity, financial scalability, accountability, and role of ownership dimensions. Joint stock corporations are shown to be extremely efficient ways to raise large amounts of money, even if they suffer principal-agent problems.",0.8601663112640381,0.8634033203125,0.8569533824920654,0.3488372093023256,0.10588235294117646,0.03571428571428572,0.23255813953488375,0.23255813953488375

The court’s decision not only shows the fundamental flaws in the mortgage system, but also reveals the real estate market as a place for investment bankers to “beat the market.” Analysis of the three mortgage markets is shown to converge at the top of the crevasse, where home buying tends to fall victim to second-order behavior. The agent based approach to modeling and prediction are also presented in the case.","Professor Rae discusses the subprime mortgage crisis. Major actors are presented and analyzed, including homebuyers, brokers, appraisers, lenders, i-banks, and rating and government agencies. Major actors’ incentives and risks are assessed.

The case reveals how the hedge funds became the biggest issuer of collateralized mortgage obligations, and how the firm became the national financial center. Mr. Alexander explores the notion that a changing financial system requires changes in the agent’s ability to distinguish himself from the other players in the economy. He ends by talking about his thoughts about the role of technology in unlocking the productive power of the capitalist system.","Jim Alexander, former CFO of the Enron subsidiary Enron Global Power and Pipeline, offers an insider’s account of Enron’s corporate culture and operations before the company’s spectacular fall. The leaders of Enron, Mr. Alexander asserts, disregarded concerns over the company’s ethics. Enron strategically found and exploited loopholes in accounting regulations to make their transactions as opaque as possible. Lack of regulation and oversight allowed Enron’s traders to inflate their numbers. Organizations that were in a position to oversee Enron’s operations sometimes faced grossly misaligned incentives that rewarded negligence.

201,"Professor this lecture, Professor Rae recapitulates the major themes of Smithism in the last three or four lectures. On one hand, the growth of wealth in the world economy has resulted in increased life expectancy and increased death rates; on the other hand, it has produced negative environmental effects and failed to benefit all countries involved. The second half of the lecture focuses on the relationship between capitalism and state power. Smith argues that capitalism is characterized by different levels of capital intensive activity, similar to the “services” that workers receive from their laborer during the factory occupation. Alexander also discusses the importance of science and innovation in capitalism.","Professor Rae introduces Adam Smith’s notion of the “invisible hand” of the market. Several preconditions must be met for the invisible hand to work. Markets must be open, and there cannot be just one buyer or one seller who can control product prices. No producer can hold a pivotal private technology, and there must be more or less truthful information across the whole market. Governments must enforce property and contracts. However, many of these preconditions are at odds with the Porter Forces, which represent general rules of thumb, or principles, for a firm trying to make above average profits. These principles include avoiding direct competition, establishing high barriers to entry, and avoiding powerful buyers and powerful suppliers. Professor Rae suggests that submission to Adam Smith’s invisible hand may be contrary to basics of corporate strategy. Corporations can leverage powerful political influence to affect the movements of the “invisible hand.” Guest speaker Jim Alexander, formerly of Enron, discusses problems of very imperfect information, as well as the principal-agent problem.

The competition is not limited to physical objects, such as roller coasters and juicers, but also involves large numbers of people competing for access to higher economic goals. At the beginning of the lecture, the topic of creative destruction was explored in depth, with particular attention paid to the development of new technologies including the Bancroft wooden racquet and the advent of the modern concept of creative reproduction. The success of these technological advances has been uneven across the world, notably in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09.","Professor Rae relates Marxist theories of monopoly capitalism to Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction. Both Marx and Schumpeter agree that capitalism is a system that is “incapable of standing still,” and is always revising (or revolutionizing) itself. Professor Rae critiques Marxist determinism and other features of Marx’s theories. To highlight Schumpeterian creative destruction, Professor Rae uses examples from technological revolutions in energy production since water-powered mills. Marx’s labor theory of value is discussed. Professor Rae highlights aspects overlooked by Marx, including supply and demand for labor, labor quality, and the role of capital in economic growth. Professor Rae also notes problems with Marx’s predictions, including the prediction that the revolution will occur in the most advanced capitalist economies.
